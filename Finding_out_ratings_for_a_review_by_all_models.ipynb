I will give the author credit for offering  a foreword that goes into the geology and palentology of his scenario. I won't nitpick any further on this: It's the author's setting, it's a given, and what the reader wants is to see is how well he uses it.As prose, this book is a step back from Alten's The Loch, which I thought a very good novel. Hell's Aquarium uses a breathless style with lots of dashes and exclamation points in the narrative.  Alten's work in The Loch showed he didn't need that sort of gimmickry, and I'm not sure why he uses it here.Most of the characters are three-dimensional: Alten has improved on this from book to book. His strength, as always, is fast-moving action, and there are some real page-turner moments. Alten has a knack for popular culture: I loved the Internet contest that resulted in naming two captive Megalodons Mary-Kate and Ashley. A final thing I liked was the ending, not for its plausibility, but for springing a genuine surprise about who lives and who dies.Alten likes to pile on the creatures and maximize their sizes.  This is ok: it's fiction, and if Peter Benchley can use a 100-foot squid, Alten can use a 122-foot Liopleurodon. (I liked his 25-foot evolved form of the vampire squid Vampyroteuthis infernalis - that would be scary as hell in real life.) It's not clear how creatures from eras over 200 million years apart could have ended up in this habitat, although I'll buy anything that allows bringing my favorite predator Dunkleosteus on stage.  Alten takes pains to emphasize there's a complete food web in the \\\"aquarium,\\\" although, like Peter Jackson's take on Skull Island, it still seems too slanted toward megapredators. All the big reptiles are here (evolved gills and all), along with a squadron of sharks and even a monster turtle. This makes for an exciting series of beast-on-beast conflicts as the humans bascially try to avoid becoming snacks. Alten has some good moments of description concerning the creatures and their dark, cold, deep habitat.As a cryptozoological researcher, I kept thinking of Bernard Heuvelmans' dissection of sea-serpent reports into as many as nine species. Alten's beasts could cover all those categories and then some. There hasn't really been a mention of cryptozoology in the Meg series since the first book, and it would have been fun to throw in a prominent cryptozoologist to react to the fact that, while cryptozoology has been chasing a new shark here and a giant eel there, there's been a horde of spectacular creatures unguessed-at.The level of cooperation and intelligence shown by some of Alten's sharks goes beyond what we know of real sharks, although the Megs, at least, have had 60 million years to evolve this way, so mark that as a permissible fiction-author liberty. At the end, two escaped Megs are setting themselves up as new apex predators of their own patch of the coastal Pacific, violently displacing the orcas which have been used to being on top. I'll be curious to see whether Alten follows that up in the next sequel. There's some interesting science he could go into, if he so chooses, about what would happen in an event like that.I thought the third Meg novel was a little better written than this one.  I thought The Loch was better still, and it puzzles me that Alten has slipped back from the quality (in this reader's opinion, of course) of his best novel.Overall, Hell's Aquarium is what it's supposed to be, which is fun. It's like going to a Transformers film. You wonder about plot holes and implausible escapes, but you came to see the robots in action. You pick up an Alten novel to see the creatures in action. Hell's Aquarium gives you what you pay for.\",\n          \"I read few detective novels but selected Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead primarily because of its setting in New Orleans, about a year after the flood, and because the Kindle edition of the novel was on sale. To my surprise, the book is not so much a detective novel as a study of the mind of a detective &#8211; in the broadest sense, a study of a seeker of truth and a solver of mysteries.Claire is a young woman who barely escaped the mean streets of her hometown, Brooklyn, New York, and then barely escaped the violent, pre-flood streets of New Orleans. Claire had been &#8220;discovered&#8221; in New Orleans by another woman detective, Constance Darling, who teaches Claire the philosophy and methodology of a legendary French detective, Jacques Silette.Some of Jacques&#8217; sayings bear repeating:&#8220;THERE ARE NO innocent victims,&#8221; wrote Jacques Silette. &#8220;The victim selects his role as carefully and unconsciously as the policeman, the detective, the client, or the villain.&#8221;&#8220;Happiness is the temporary result of denying the knowledge one already has,&#8221; Silette wrote.&#8220;The client is the errant goat that leads Persephone to the weak spot of earth where Pluto can let her in. &#8220;No one remembers the name of the goat. Everybody remembers the name of the first detective, Persephone.&#8221;Ostensibly, the narrative follows Claire&#8217;s efforts to find out what happened to Vic Willing, a Prosecutor for the City of New Orleans, who disappeared during the aftermath of the flood, but apparently not as a result of the flood. His nephew, who requests Claire&#8217;s assistance, believes that his uncle was murdered but no one will admit to the crime or reveal how or why he died. Claire follows a collection of clues, which seem to point to one of several local teenage gang members, who knew Vic and had ample reasons to want him dead.The book&#8217;s most intimate and revealing discoveries, however, relate to Claire herself &#8211; her friendship with two other girls in Brooklyn who also wanted to be detectives, one of whom disappeared without a trace one evening in the New York subway system. Claire&#8217;s own mentor, Constance Darling, was murdered in New Orleans about six years ago. As a result, Claire in some ways is as lost, mentally erratic, alcoholic, and drug-dependent as the teenage gang members she meets in New Orleans. In fact, her own experience makes it possible for her to understand these teenage boys and penetrate their circle of friendships and secrecy. Her discoveries about Vic Willings&#8217; own secrets are shocking but Vic&#8217;s other actions are also somewhat surprising, if not redeeming.The portrait of New Orleans is quite frightening and differs greatly from my own perception of the city, which I gained as a tourist about two years before Hurricane Katrina. Post-Katrina New Orleans is no place for the weak. A few quotations illustrate the current state:&#8221;Further, the police department was renowned around the world for its incompetence and its inability to work with other agencies, as was the DA&#8217;s office. Between the two of them big cases just didn&#8217;t work. New Orleans&#8217; labyrinthine legal system, based on the Napoleonic Code, didn&#8217;t help matters. Put it all together and New Orleans had both the highest murder rate and one of the lowest conviction rates in the country.&#8221;&#8220;People were few and far between. I saw some cleaning their houses or walking toward the functioning strips of the city. I saw more sitting on porches, doing what people do when they&#8217;re overwhelmed. Just trying to think of where to begin was enough to make you sit back down and not get up. . . . It had been more than a year since the storm. But on some blocks it was as if nothing had happened since then; literally nothing, not even a breeze.&#8221;Claire&#8217;s own bravery throughout the story and her compassion for her subjects makes this detective novel well worth reading.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Actual Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          1,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Predicted Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          0,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
