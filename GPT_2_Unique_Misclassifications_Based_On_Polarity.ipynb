I'm trying to like this book, it had so many good reviews.  I have some of this author's other cookbooks, have been very pleased.  On the plus side, the recipes look very healthy.   \n",

I thought it was a little heavy on the nitty-gritty of the investigation and a little light on story and plot, but if you're a CSI fan, you will probably enjoy it.  I did.   \n",

Almost didn't finish it, but I'm glad I did because the end was the best part of the book, nicely wrapping up all of the various plot ends.  I didn't know enough about abalone to care about their poaching, my problem, but it wasn't until mid-book that there was a brief explanation of why they were even a product anyone would want to poach, and why I should care. And what about all of the shells, doesn't someone want to make jewelry and buttons?  The main character Marquez, game warden, didn't have the flair of some other game wardens I have read and reviewed lately.  Perhaps the plodding day to day activity more accurately reflects the life, but it doesn't make for an exciting read. The pregnant partner not wanting to go on desk duty was too obvious that something ill fated was in store for her.  That was the only tension: when is this going to happen.  The attempt to make informer Davies believably eccentric fell short in that, like all of the characters, he needed more fleshing out.  The best and redeeming part of the book is when Marquez talks to his step daughter about her depression and eating disorder (if only it were that easy, but still perhaps helpful to some in similar situations). I think the basic idea was sound, just needed something more...maybe some more use of dialog to set up characters and less brief descriptions of the action.   \n",

The author made Christian Grey likable by making him truly sincere, decent, and loving. He is also a self-made billionaire at 27 and a complete sex-expert. He speaks fluent French and plays the piano like a pro. Oh, and obviously he is a brilliant Harvard drop-out. Clearly, Christian is the hottest emotional mess with mommy issues the author could possibly come up with. In real life, though, people like him are also self-absorbed narcissists and ruthless sociopaths, so what women should do when they come across somebody like him is run as far away from him as they can. There's some obsession in our society with dysfunctional personalities, which I do not seem to share. I heard that in the second book they have a vanilla relationship, so maybe the second book is worth reading more than the first one.   \n",

Deveraux is employed as a public defender, but is rescued from the world of arraignments because of his privileged past, and is allowed to second-seat the head of the office as defense counsel on a murder trial.This writer doesn't want to give the story away, but the narrative does ring true as a real story of a real lawyer, except perhaps when the criminals in the story use criminal slang ten times too many.  The title refers to the fact that most criminal activity occurs at night, so if one could find \"A Cure for Night\" there would be little need for criminal defense.Early in the book, Joel and the paralegal discuss the prospects for her entering law school, and it is clear then that anyone should think very carefully about whether they are suited for the practice of law.  By the suspenseful end, Joel has certainly figured this out.   \n",

It is really part cookbook and part fun read, however, as much of the book is taken up with the recipes.  After reading it, I passed it on to a friend who is from Nashville and who enjoys the southern culture and cooking.  Enjoy it for a light read and a few laughs but know that it contains more recipes than anything else.   \n",

It's got lots of glossy pictures of delicious-looking cakes and an extensive guide on cooking implements. Yup, beautiful.Now, I did expect, coming from a very famous, skilled chef, to get a book that wasn't exactly what you'd call simple. Of course, his experience was going to show somewhere so no, I didn't expect easy stuff. But I'm something of an avid baker so even if I don't have any professional training, I do pretty well in the kitchen. Imagine my surprise when several of his recipes did flop on me. This is ridiculous! I'm one to follow instructions to the best of my abilities but I think he takes for granted that you know so much more on so many levels than any non-chef does. I never did try the failed recipes again but did try others and fared a little better. They really are delicious.  Still, I don't like thinking when I start baking that there's a 50% chance that the recipe may not come out well.Never had any trouble at all baking extensively from other books. This one, I'm getting a little bit better but by trial and error, not through useful insight gained from the book. But the best part, this book does inspire me to keep trying.I'll get your cakes yet, Nick Malgieri!   \n",
              "14  Tintin is sent by his Brussels newspaper to expose the true conditions of life in Bolshevik Russia, and counter the propaganda spread by Soviets and their Western fellow-travellers.  Together with his faithful fox terrier Snowy, Tintin finds famine, child hunger, bureaucratic incompetence, industrial failure, bogus propaganda, state terror, gunpoint elections and massive embezzlement of the people's wealth by the government.  Naturally, the Soviets aren't terribly keen for such information to leak out, and attempt to dispatch our hero at every turn - trying to bomb, shoot at, torture and freeze him in the endless snowy Steppes.'Tintin In The Land Of The Soviets' is the first Tintin adventure, written in 1929 for a Catholic newspaper edited by a priest who would become a Nazi collaborator.  The book's propaganda is crude - as the translators point out, Herge never visited Russia, and based his 'facts' on a contemporary, reactionary book by a Belgian consul - and leaves a sour taste in the mouth.  It's not that what he shows wasn't accurate - his Soviet Russia is a totalitarian nightmare, swarming with vicious secret police; a place where citizens had their property stolen and labour abused; where starvation, torture and murder was rife; where more state effort went into destruction than construction.  The book is filled with booze-sozzled goons are frightening precisely because they have a power they don't deserve.  A lingering superstitiousness undermines this brave new world, and the images are full of delapidation and things crashing and falling apart - nothing can possibly work in such an environment.  The 'Wizard of Oz'-like scene where a guide shows gullible English communists industrial marvels that are really two men billowing smoke and rattling sheet metal, is horribly accurate.  This comic look at misery and tyranny looks forward to the Czech films of the 60s.  Nonetheless, the book never becomes satire, never moves beyond popular prejudices - the critique in 'Tintin In America' is far more effective because Herge displays a more thorough knowledge of and engagement with US history and culture.The 'Tintin's we are familiar with now - painstakingly illustrated, beautifully coloured and meticulously detailed albums - only came into being in the mid-40s: earlier editions were redrafted and edited to fit the new format.  This book was the only one Herge didn't remodel, perhaps embarrassed in retrospect by its crass ideology.  Reading 'Soviets' after one of the later 'Tintin's is like watching an Ub Iwerks cartoon after 'Toy Story'.  The drawing is sometimes cruder and much less detailed than we're used to, like a loose-limbed 'Peanuts' strip.  Instead of the four strips of four columns of the later books, there are three strips of two columns - each frame is much larger and seems to lunge at the reader.  The positioning of speech bubbles is often clumsy; frequently, characters redundantly say what we can clearly see; the angle of compositions sometimes works against the action - all this can prevent a fluid reading.  Tintin himself is a different beast - beefier, more aggressive, even high-handed with a splendidly cynical Snowy - he roughs up a Cheka agent, easily dispatches a vodka-guzzling bear, and trips up passers-by whenever the need arises.Despite these flaws, 'Soviets' is a pacy and funny adventure.  Two things Herge arrived with fully formed were: his ability to express speed within and across frames; and his fascination with gorgeous moving vehicles (motorcars, trains, planes, boats) stretching across the plate.   \n",

It makes you wonder how this girl ever managed to grow up to be a decent upstanding daughter with a mother who was an alcoholic that never could accept being left behind , a father who put more into his career than he did his family and a step mother who tried her best to be the picture of a loving mother. Really is a good book.   \n",

I'm not a fan of short stories, especially short romances - girl always gets guy with no conflict whatsoever. This story was an advertisement for a charity helping single mothers, which was annoying. How hard the life is for single mothers was over-emphasized - it became a bit preachy by the end of the story. Hello, why not single parents? Why just single mothers? Single dads have the same issues (child care, time off from work for sick kids, having to do it all, etc.). Bottom-line - it's free, reading it passed the time, and since it was short, the preaching ended before it was too annoying. Just be aware of what you're getting - this is not the usual Robin Carr, which I really enjoy.   \n",

Why did I keep reading? Bored I guess.  The story goes back and forth between two different people Hahp and Sadima. It gets you really mad with most of the characters expecially Somiss. Hardly anything possitive happens and you keep reading hoping that this depressing book will get better. I'm not always looking for happy endings but geesh.... This was bad.   \n",

I loved the first two books and didn't really care for the last one at all, so probably won't read the others, if any are forthcoming. It's like the author got lost after book 2 and now doesn't know how to end it. I read the sample from book 4 and was bored with the repetitious nature within 40 pages - think it's played out.   \n",

The authors take the history of Freemasonry (actually, the mystic legends that surround Freemasonry) and tie it to the &quot;real&quot; story of Jesus Christ. When you link conspiracies to Christianity, you're going to get under someone's skin.But few books are as fascinating to read as this one. Think of it as one-third truth and two-thirds speculation. If the authors called it a fictional account --- a fantasy about the way things might be --- the result would be a strange sort of historical novel. It's wouldn't be as compelling. Instead, they present this story as nonfiction, breathlessly uncovering the greatest secret in the history of mankind. It's an approach that keeps you reading. In the end, you'll enjoy the story as a series of curious &quot;what if&quot; possibilities. If half of this is true, the world is more interesting than you thought.   \n",

Could Cornwell create new characters as likeable and intriguing as Scarpetta et al?  Hornet's Nest was interesting, a good read,  but Southern Cross goes just a bit too far -- I found myself wondering if I  was reading a serious crime novel or a spoof of a crime novel. The plot is  a bit of a stretch, and overall, the book lacks a certain edge that  Cornwell has consistently demonstrated in her Scarpetta novels.   \n",

Frederica has been raised by liberal college professor parents and is just beginning to rebel against their egalitarian child rearing practises when her father's unscrupulous and melodramatic ex-wife arrives on campus to stir things up in their well-ordered lives.Elinor Lipman is one of my favorite contemporary authors; her books are funny in an understated way, character driven, with ironic plot twists and satirical observations of modern life. If you click on the other Amazon reviews, you will find reviews that get rather defensive about why funny books can also be very good literature and why women's books can rise above chic-lit, but still be popular, and why Elinor Lipman has devoted fans but really ought to be a best-selling author and is under appreciated. And of course the nod to Jane Austen to whom all good women authors who write comedies of manners or anything close are compared. Leaving aside the defensiveness about humor and the obsession with Austen as the standard for all women's writing, you should read Lipman's books if you like a sardonic look at modern life. Readers don't have to suffer through oh-so-serious tomes to enjoy good literature. To find out more about her, read some of her essays posted on her website.   \n",

A really great storyline but just too slow and unromantic for my part. Definitely a good on  for most other readers though so enjoy.   \n",

First, the narrator, Essie, makes the following disclaimer within the first few pages: \"You''ll say I wasn't everywhere; you'll say there's no way I can know all that I've depicted. But I stand by all the truths in this story of deception.\" Unfortunately, just because you acknowledge upfront the improbabilities in the narrative given the author's chosen point of view, that doesn't make the improbabilities go away. That disclaimer actually makes things worse since it calls attention to the novel's big flaw.And I'm not sure if what I'm about to say will make much sense. This isn't by any means a bad book. In fact this book is quite well written. But it is written in the identical polished prose that I come across in so much serious contemporary literature. And for me it is becoming a little boring. I suppose what I'm talking about is style, or the lack thereof. For me this isn't a distinct or unique voice.   \n",

After the Battle of Loos he convalesced in Hampshire. A telegram summoned him to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Walter Bullivant. There is a potential danger from the Turkish Empire against the Allies. Hannay is to travel there to learn about this menace (Chapter 1). Hannay picks two aides: Sandy Arbuthnot and John S. Blenkiron (Chapter 2). In Portugal Hannay meets Peter Pienaar and takes him along (Chapter 3). They all travel into Germany and meet Ulric von Stumm (Chapter 4). The next two chapters tell of their travels in Germany. Hannay makes his escape and finds a refuge in the snowstorm (Chapter 7). He left to find a boat on the Danube (Chapter 8). Hannay finds Peter Pienaar and takes him aboard (Chapter 9). They arrive in Constantinople and find it eventful (Chapter 10). Will they be caught by their enemies (Chapter 11)?They rejoin Sandy and John. Germany wants to control the Near East (Chapter12). Hannay now poses as an American (Chapter 13). When Peter and Richard are lost at night they find a house and are directed back to the city (Chapter 14). A meeting with a Turkish officer creates a dangerous situation. Hilda von Einem visits him (Chapter 15). They all travel towards Erzerum and their motorcar breaks down (Chapter16). They steal another car to continue their journey but are arrested (Chapter 17). They are able to escape to a house outside the city (Chapter 18). Can they get the military secrets to the Russians (Chapter 19)? Chapter 20 tells how Peter crossed No-Man's Land in the night to reach the Russians. Richard and his friends try to escape to the Russian lines but are trapped on a hill (Chapter 21). Just as it seems hopeless the Russian guns and Cossack cavalry sweep away the Turkish army and German troops to provide a happy ending (Chapter 22). [Will this counteract the defeat at Gallipolli?]This was written in 1916, a bad year for the Allies. The German air force dominated the skies, until more advanced airplanes were produced for the French and British. This book can be viewed as propaganda for the Allied cause, a wish for the Russians to defeat Germany and come west. It points out the German interest in the oil-rich lands of the then Turkish Empire. Details of this story seem dated, but provides a view into the culture. John Buchan was a writer, barrister, member of Parliament, partner in a publishing house, a Church of Scotland official, and Governor-General of Canada. Few novelists have such a background.   \n",

We know who did it, but it was never stated in the book, therefore left with loose ends.Other than that, it was a very good book with many lines of suspense, and in the end our friend, Harry Bosch, comes out all right.   \n",

I did notice a few spelling errors that really did bother me. Don't people proof read before publishing a book? I did love the characters names! Avery and Cam make a great couple.   \n",

It's very well written and unlike many digital books, it was almost free of typos and miss-used words.  I read this type of novel for the mystery and crime interest rather than romance.  I appreciated the relationship that developed between the lead female and the male ex-cop, but I skimmed multiple paragraphs in order to avoid reading the descriptions of the love-making scenes.   \n",

I chose this book because I have read all the other books in the series and wanted to see what happens next.Rebecca Myles keeps her private life and her work life far apart as possible. She was badly hurt by her last Dom which has made her wary of getting into any serious relationship in general. She is a very smart and confident woman. She knows what she wants in her professional life and goes for it.Tyler Stone is not used to being turned down when I comes to business. He only wants the best and gets it. He is a handsome and dominating personality in and out of the bedroom.One of the problems I had with this story was it is unrealistic that a boss is close friends to be invited to a gathering outside of work. Especially a company the size that was depicted. In addition, who really wants there boss to see them outside of work? Maybe I am different but work is work and personal life is personal life.The chemistry between Rebecca and Tyler was off the charts. The sex scenes are very hot and spicy but there were not enough BDSM elements. I did not get the sensory deprivation tank. I know some people enjoy it but it was not believable that she adjusted so well in her first trip inside the tank.This was a very well written story. I wish there was more description of BDSM elements in their relationship. Overall, this was a wonderful story and a great addition to the story. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series.   \n",

And the best part is that it's got little quotes from fathers throughout, including the most anguished, troubled kinds of dilemmas, making me feel more human for my difficulty rising to the challenge sometimes. One Dad laments, \"It all seems like a blur. I sometimes have to fight very hard to remember what he was like even one month or one week ago. Every time I turn around, he's doing something new. I don't want to miss anything. It all makes me wonder whether I've been around enough.\" But then beautiful moments too, \"She screams with delight and babbles incessantly. Who knows what she's thinking.\" \"My son's crawling. He comes bouncing up to me, smiling his head off. It cracks me up, and I laugh hysterically. He crawls right up on my lap and nibbles my nose.\" I'd grade this a B.   \n",

I really enjoy the early Sharpe work that Mr. Cornwell has written and his King Arthur trilogy is one of the most stirring accomplishments of the last 50 years. BUT Thomas of Hookton is no Richard Sharpe and the Grail is no Excalibur.  'Vagabond' is uneven in places with no real sense of 'quest' about it.  For all the roaming around our hero does, he seems to be jogging in place.  The killing of two characters from the earlier book is pointless and does nothing to further the story except clear the way for Thomas' former lover to return.  By the way, how many sieges must we read about?  This book has one at the beginning and one at the end.  Most redundant, considering we have already experienced a siege in 'The Archers Tale'.  Wait till the paperback comes out.   \n",

But when Becca's best friend Heather begs her to help prove that her parents are not enemies of the State, Becca starts to spy on her mother, suspecting her of arranging false confessions which cause innocent people to be tortured.Becca is a good character. She is honest and loyal, refusing to believe that Heather and her parents are the enemy, even when the whole school is against them. You can imagine how you would feel if your best friends parents were in this kind of trouble and you would want to help or believe it was all a mistake. Becca's snooping and her unguarded comments to her mother and friends is showing dissident traits which could see her executed if she is reported but she won't abandon her principles for an easier life, even if it is safer. I found Heather to be frustrating and a bit too changable to like but her character again is well written. When Jake comes on the scene, you are never too sure about him or his motivations which adds a bit of interest. The character that interested me the most was Becca's mother as we see different sides to her through the book that I liked. She is afraid of her daughter's behaviour and has to juggle loyalty to her with the demands of her job. She was complex and fun to read about and I think Becca's view of her mother is a bit unfair at times.The book flows nicely with no big info dumps or pointless descriptions. It is simple and effective character based storytelling which I like to see in a book. I also felt that the length of the book was just right. Adding more to it may have made the book feel too slow and having less would have resulted in missing out on the complex evolving of each character. It is good to see the author get the balance right.Plot wise, I liked the twists and turns as you are never quite sure what is going to be coming next. It gives you a real idea of what it would be like to live in this suspicious world where everyone is watching you to see that you conform to the government way of thinking. At the same time, the setting for the book is very much like the present day which lets the reader imagine that this could actually happen to them and lets them relate to the characters and their struggles. I like that the characters are flawed and make bad decisions.Overall this was a good novella/short book for YA and adult fans of dystopian books. No sexual scenes or f bombs every page.I rate this book 3 out of 5 on my star rating which is different to this site.1-didn't like2-ok3-like4-really liked5-loved   \n",

They were cute reads just not enough to truly pull it together. Have to say its not worth a reread. :(   \n",

It was full of facts on health benefits (most chiles do have capsicum which provide all sorts of healing benefits), and the recipes were mouthwatering. My only gripe was the book needed some editing, and it would have seen much more authoritative. John McDonalds get an A+++ for enthusiasm, and I love how he teaches you to make your own tasty Sriracha. If the book gets the edits it needs, I'd definitely bump up my star rating. Don't let the editorial issues dissuade you, though. What he lacks in this, he totally makes up for in love and enthusiasm!Disclosure: I received the book for the purposes of the review, but opinions are 100% mine and not influenced by other parties.   \n",

This book is certainly the deep end of the pool. It is the culmination of fifteen years' of scholarly research and is presented as a detailed apologetical of his faith. Of its 1000+ pages, 400 are appendices and notes.SACRED FIRE is so big it requires its own luggage. I had to valet check it. Not for the casual reader or faint of heart. But if someone ever challenges the fact that Washington was a Christian, you can whack him in the head with this book: it is pursuasive.   \n",

And what about all of the shells, doesn't someone want to make jewelry and buttons?  The main character Marquez, game warden, didn't have the flair of some other game wardens I have read and reviewed lately.  Perhaps the plodding day to day activity more accurately reflects the life, but it doesn't make for an exciting read. The pregnant partner not wanting to go on desk duty was too obvious that something ill fated was in store for her.  That was the only tension: when is this going to happen.  The attempt to make informer Davies believably eccentric fell short in that, like all of the characters, he needed more fleshing out.  The best and redeeming part of the book is when Marquez talks to his step daughter about her depression and eating disorder (if only it were that easy, but still perhaps helpful to some in similar situations). I think the basic idea was sound, just needed something more...maybe some more use of dialog to set up characters and less brief descriptions of the action.</td>\n",

Clearly, Christian is the hottest emotional mess with mommy issues the author could possibly come up with.

Deveraux is employed as a public defender, but is rescued from the world of arraignments because of his privileged past, and is allowed to second-seat the head of the office as defense counsel on a murder trial.This writer doesn't want to give the story away, but the narrative does ring true as a real story of a real lawyer, except perhaps when the criminals in the story use criminal slang ten times too many.  The title refers to the fact that most criminal activity occurs at night, so if one could find \"A Cure for Night\" there would be little need for criminal defense.Early in the book, Joel and the paralegal discuss the prospects for her entering law school, and it is clear then that anyone should think very carefully about whether they are suited for the practice of law.  By the suspenseful end, Joel has certainly figured this out.</td>\n",

Together with his faithful fox terrier Snowy, Tintin finds famine, child hunger, bureaucratic incompetence, industrial failure, bogus propaganda, state terror, gunpoint elections and massive embezzlement of the people's wealth by the government.  Naturally, the Soviets aren't terribly keen for such information to leak out, and attempt to dispatch our hero at every turn - trying to bomb, shoot at, torture and freeze him in the endless snowy Steppes.'Tintin In The Land Of The Soviets' is the first Tintin adventure, written in 1929 for a Catholic newspaper edited by a priest who would become a Nazi collaborator.  The book's propaganda is crude - as the translators point out, Herge never visited Russia, and based his 'facts' on a contemporary, reactionary book by a Belgian consul - and leaves a sour taste in the mouth.  It's not that what he shows wasn't accurate - his Soviet Russia is a totalitarian nightmare, swarming with vicious secret police; a place where citizens had their property stolen and labour abused; where starvation, torture and murder was rife; where more state effort went into destruction than construction.  The book is filled with booze-sozzled goons are frightening precisely because they have a power they don't deserve.  A lingering superstitiousness undermines this brave new world, and the images are full of delapidation and things crashing and falling apart - nothing can possibly work in such an environment.  The 'Wizard of Oz'-like scene where a guide shows gullible English communists industrial marvels that are really two men billowing smoke and rattling sheet metal, is horribly accurate.  This comic look at misery and tyranny looks forward to the Czech films of the 60s.  Nonetheless, the book never becomes satire, never moves beyond popular prejudices - the critique in 'Tintin In America' is far more effective because Herge displays a more thorough knowledge of and engagement with US history and culture.The 'Tintin's we are familiar with now - painstakingly illustrated, beautifully coloured and meticulously detailed albums - only came into being in the mid-40s: earlier editions were redrafted and edited to fit the new format.  This book was the only one Herge didn't remodel, perhaps embarrassed in retrospect by its crass ideology.  Reading 'Soviets' after one of the later 'Tintin's is like watching an Ub Iwerks cartoon after 'Toy Story'.  The drawing is sometimes cruder and much less detailed than we're used to, like a loose-limbed 'Peanuts' strip.  Instead of the four strips of four columns of the later books, there are three strips of two columns - each frame is much larger and seems to lunge at the reader.  The positioning of speech bubbles is often clumsy; frequently, characters redundantly say what we can clearly see; the angle of compositions sometimes works against the action - all this can prevent a fluid reading.  Tintin himself is a different beast - beefier, more aggressive, even high-handed with a splendidly cynical Snowy - he roughs up a Cheka agent, easily dispatches a vodka-guzzling bear, and trips up passers-by whenever the need arises.Despite these flaws, 'Soviets' is a pacy and funny adventure.  Two things Herge arrived with fully formed were: his ability to express speed within and across frames; and his fascination with gorgeous moving vehicles (motorcars, trains, planes, boats) stretching across the plate.</td>\n",

The authors take the history of Freemasonry (actually, the mystic legends that surround Freemasonry) and tie it to the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; story of Jesus Christ. When you link conspiracies to Christianity, you're going to get under someone's skin.But few books are as fascinating to read as this one. Think of it as one-third truth and two-thirds speculation. If the authors called it a fictional account --- a fantasy about the way things might be --- the result would be a strange sort of historical novel. It's wouldn't be as compelling. Instead, they present this story as nonfiction, breathlessly uncovering the greatest secret in the history of mankind. It's an approach that keeps you reading. In the end, you'll enjoy the story as a series of curious &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; possibilities. If half of this is true, the world is more interesting than you thought.</td>\n",

Frederica has been raised by liberal college professor parents and is just beginning to rebel against their egalitarian child rearing practises when her father's unscrupulous and melodramatic ex-wife arrives on campus to stir things up in their well-ordered lives.Elinor Lipman is one of my favorite contemporary authors; her books are funny in an understated way, character driven, with ironic plot twists and satirical observations of modern life. If you click on the other Amazon reviews, you will find reviews that get rather defensive about why funny books can also be very good literature and why women's books can rise above chic-lit, but still be popular, and why Elinor Lipman has devoted fans but really ought to be a best-selling author and is under appreciated. And of course the nod to Jane Austen to whom all good women authors who write comedies of manners or anything close are compared. Leaving aside the defensiveness about humor and the obsession with Austen as the standard for all women's writing, you should read Lipman's books if you like a sardonic look at modern life. Readers don't have to suffer through oh-so-serious tomes to enjoy good literature. To find out more about her, read some of her essays posted on her website.</td>\n",

That disclaimer actually makes things worse since it calls attention to the novel's big flaw.And I'm not sure if what I'm about to say will make much sense. This isn't by any means a bad book.

A telegram summoned him to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Walter Bullivant. There is a potential danger from the Turkish Empire against the Allies. Hannay is to travel there to learn about this menace (Chapter 1). Hannay picks two aides: Sandy Arbuthnot and John S. Blenkiron (Chapter 2). In Portugal Hannay meets Peter Pienaar and takes him along (Chapter 3). They all travel into Germany and meet Ulric von Stumm (Chapter 4). The next two chapters tell of their travels in Germany. Hannay makes his escape and finds a refuge in the snowstorm (Chapter 7). He left to find a boat on the Danube (Chapter 8). Hannay finds Peter Pienaar and takes him aboard (Chapter 9). They arrive in Constantinople and find it eventful (Chapter 10). Will they be caught by their enemies (Chapter 11)?They rejoin Sandy and John. Germany wants to control the Near East (Chapter12). Hannay now poses as an American (Chapter 13). When Peter and Richard are lost at night they find a house and are directed back to the city (Chapter 14). A meeting with a Turkish officer creates a dangerous situation. Hilda von Einem visits him (Chapter 15). They all travel towards Erzerum and their motorcar breaks down (Chapter16). They steal another car to continue their journey but are arrested (Chapter 17). They are able to escape to a house outside the city (Chapter 18). Can they get the military secrets to the Russians (Chapter 19)? Chapter 20 tells how Peter crossed No-Man's Land in the night to reach the Russians. Richard and his friends try to escape to the Russian lines but are trapped on a hill (Chapter 21). Just as it seems hopeless the Russian guns and Cossack cavalry sweep away the Turkish army and German troops to provide a happy ending (Chapter 22). [Will this counteract the defeat at Gallipolli?]This was written in 1916, a bad year for the Allies. The German air force dominated the skies, until more advanced airplanes were produced for the French and British. This book can be viewed as propaganda for the Allied cause, a wish for the Russians to defeat Germany and come west. It points out the German interest in the oil-rich lands of the then Turkish Empire. Details of this story seem dated, but provides a view into the culture. John Buchan was a writer, barrister, member of Parliament, partner in a publishing house, a Church of Scotland official, and Governor-General of Canada. Few novelists have such a background.</td>\n",

I chose this book because I have read all the other books in the series and wanted to see what happens next.Rebecca Myles keeps her private life and her work life far apart as possible. She was badly hurt by her last Dom which has made her wary of getting into any serious relationship in general. She is a very smart and confident woman. She knows what she wants in her professional life and goes for it.Tyler Stone is not used to being turned down when I comes to business. He only wants the best and gets it. He is a handsome and dominating personality in and out of the bedroom.One of the problems I had with this story was it is unrealistic that a boss is close friends to be invited to a gathering outside of work. Especially a company the size that was depicted. In addition, who really wants there boss to see them outside of work? Maybe I am different but work is work and personal life is personal life.The chemistry between Rebecca and Tyler was off the charts. The sex scenes are very hot and spicy but there were not enough BDSM elements. I did not get the sensory deprivation tank. I know some people enjoy it but it was not believable that she adjusted so well in her first trip inside the tank.This was a very well written story. I wish there was more description of BDSM elements in their relationship. Overall, this was a wonderful story and a great addition to the story.

But when Becca's best friend Heather begs her to help prove that her parents are not enemies of the State, Becca starts to spy on her mother, suspecting her of arranging false confessions which cause innocent people to be tortured.Becca is a good character. She is honest and loyal, refusing to believe that Heather and her parents are the enemy, even when the whole school is against them. You can imagine how you would feel if your best friends parents were in this kind of trouble and you would want to help or believe it was all a mistake. Becca's snooping and her unguarded comments to her mother and friends is showing dissident traits which could see her executed if she is reported but she won't abandon her principles for an easier life, even if it is safer. I found Heather to be frustrating and a bit too changable to like but her character again is well written. When Jake comes on the scene, you are never too sure about him or his motivations which adds a bit of interest. The character that interested me the most was Becca's mother as we see different sides to her through the book that I liked. She is afraid of her daughter's behaviour and has to juggle loyalty to her with the demands of her job. She was complex and fun to read about and I think Becca's view of her mother is a bit unfair at times.The book flows nicely with no big info dumps or pointless descriptions. It is simple and effective character based storytelling which I like to see in a book. I also felt that the length of the book was just right. Adding more to it may have made the book feel too slow and having less would have resulted in missing out on the complex evolving of each character. It is good to see the author get the balance right.Plot wise, I liked the twists and turns as you are never quite sure what is going to be coming next. It gives you a real idea of what it would be like to live in this suspicious world where everyone is watching you to see that you conform to the government way of thinking. At the same time, the setting for the book is very much like the present day which lets the reader imagine that this could actually happen to them and lets them relate to the characters and their struggles. I like that the characters are flawed and make bad decisions.Overall this was a good novella/short book for YA and adult fans of dystopian books. No sexual scenes or f bombs every page.I rate this book 3 out of 5 on my star rating which is different to this site.1-didn't like2-ok3-like4-really liked5-loved</td>\n",

After the Battle of Loos he convalesced in Hampshire. A telegram summoned him to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Walter Bullivant. There is a potential danger from the Turkish Empire against the Allies. Hannay is to travel there to learn about this menace (Chapter 1). Hannay picks two aides: Sandy Arbuthnot and John S. Blenkiron (Chapter 2). In Portugal Hannay meets Peter Pienaar and takes him along (Chapter 3). They all travel into Germany and meet Ulric von Stumm (Chapter 4). The next two chapters tell of their travels in Germany. Hannay makes his escape and finds a refuge in the snowstorm (Chapter 7). He left to find a boat on the Danube (Chapter 8). Hannay finds Peter Pienaar and takes him aboard (Chapter 9). They arrive in Constantinople and find it eventful (Chapter 10). Will they be caught by their enemies (Chapter 11)?They rejoin Sandy and John. Germany wants to control the Near East (Chapter12). Hannay now poses as an American (Chapter 13). When Peter and Richard are lost at night they find a house and are directed back to the city (Chapter 14). A meeting with a Turkish officer creates a dangerous situation. Hilda von Einem visits him (Chapter 15). They all travel towards Erzerum and their motorcar breaks down (Chapter16). They steal another car to continue their journey but are arrested (Chapter 17). They are able to escape to a house outside the city (Chapter 18). Can they get the military secrets to the Russians (Chapter 19)? Chapter 20 tells how Peter crossed No-Man's Land in the night to reach the Russians. Richard and his friends try to escape to the Russian lines but are trapped on a hill (Chapter 21). Just as it seems hopeless the Russian guns and Cossack cavalry sweep away the Turkish army and German troops to provide a happy ending (Chapter 22). [Will this counteract the defeat at Gallipolli?]This was written in 1916, a bad year for the Allies. The German air force dominated the skies, until more advanced airplanes were produced for the French and British. This book can be viewed as propaganda for the Allied cause, a wish for the Russians to defeat Germany and come west. It points out the German interest in the oil-rich lands of the then Turkish Empire. Details of this story seem dated, but provides a view into the culture. John Buchan was a writer, barrister, member of Parliament, partner in a publishing house, a Church of Scotland official, and Governor-General of Canada. Few novelists have such a background.\",\n          \"While I didn't look forward to this as much as Brott's New Father, let alone Lamott's Operating Instructions, I did find parts of it really funny. And the best part is that it's got little quotes from fathers throughout, including the most anguished, troubled kinds of dilemmas, making me feel more human for my difficulty rising to the challenge sometimes. One Dad laments, \\\"It all seems like a blur. I sometimes have to fight very hard to remember what he was like even one month or one week ago. Every time I turn around, he's doing something new. I don't want to miss anything. It all makes me wonder whether I've been around enough.\\\" But then beautiful moments too, \\\"She screams with delight and babbles incessantly. Who knows what she's thinking.\\\" \\\"My son's crawling. He comes bouncing up to me, smiling his head off. It cracks me up, and I laugh hysterically. He crawls right up on my lap and nibbles my nose.\\\" I'd grade this a B.\",\n          \"I have two problems with this book. First, the narrator, Essie, makes the following disclaimer within the first few pages: \\\"You''ll say I wasn't everywhere; you'll say there's no way I can know all that I've depicted. But I stand by all the truths in this story of deception.\\\" Unfortunately, just because you acknowledge upfront the improbabilities in the narrative given the author's chosen point of view, that doesn't make the improbabilities go away. That disclaimer actually makes things worse since it calls attention to the novel's big flaw.And I'm not sure if what I'm about to say will make much sense. This isn't by any means a bad book. In fact this book is quite well written. But it is written in the identical polished prose that I come across in so much serious contemporary literature. And for me it is becoming a little boring. I suppose what I'm talking about is style, or the lack thereof.

                                               Because there are so many authors i have had the priviledge to read, i thought that Miss Ashley would bring it with this series installment. I only feel this way because all of her earlier novel were off the chain. Please don't make us wait so long if the book is going to be that short.   \n",

It's written as mostly anecdotes. The author also give some personal accounts about how this innovation bled into his training and practice as a physician.Unlike other readers, I didn't take the &#34;exploration&#34; title literally.  I think the exploration in the title is more scientific exploration of the limits of the human body.  That being said, one of the most interesting chapters was &#34;Ice,&#34; which did feature actual exploration.I thought the chapters on space were a bit thin and I, personally, could have done without them.   \n",

The premise and the potential for a great story is presented in the description, and it was a book that I jumped at the offer to review.  While I have not read the first, Blindfolded Innocence, I didn&#8217;t find that I was greatly hampered with not having the information from that book, and I went and grabbed it for my own library just to continue the ride in my &#8216;free&#8217; time.Brad and Julia are an interesting couple: their dynamic is still growing, as they are learning to deal with the emotional connection between them, and what that may mean.  Julia is a lighthearted and fun character, while she doesn&#8217;t seem to allow the emotional or sexual constraints to weigh her down, she is clearly carefully processing and integrating these changes, not nearly as carefree as one might expect.  There are moments where her immaturity grates, and I wondered about her appeal to someone more mature, but there was growth for her in this story, and I started to see Brad&#8217;s whys.Brad is far more serious, perhaps even a tad too much in his own head. As he reveals the secrets that have helped to shape his demeanor and reserve, the reasons do start to come clear, and it is more than obvious to everyone that Julia is just what he needs to take the edge off.A true study in the dynamics of love and trust: Julia displays so much confidence in Brad, her willingness to try first before dismissing outright scenes and situations that are unknown or even scary.  The balance between Dominant and submissive, and the effort expended by Brad to try and keep pushing Julia&#8217;s boundaries was detailed with grace and style: Julia&#8217;s willingness to trust in him, and give him the power to expose her to new and often scary situations show the clear need for a solid understanding and baseline of trust between any couple in the scene.While some may see Brad&#8217;s introduction of others into their relationship as a selfish and perhaps misogynistic act, it really serves to underline the careful study he has made of her, finding new experiences that he believes that she will enjoy, even as she had not contemplated those herself.  And steamy, squirmy hot does not even come close to describing the lushly detailed, sensually presented scenes that display their passion.Secondary characters and plotting elements add to the story, Martha is wonderful and shows a different side of Brad and his life and what he needs with her take no prisoners style and approach.  Add to that the murder and danger to Julia, and the twists provided there and the story becomes one that is hard to put down.Overall I really enjoyed this story and didn&#8217;t find a great lack of information in not reading the first of the series.  Moments of frustration with Julia&#8217;s immaturity were offset by the solid writing and clever details that kept me wondering what would happen next.  And the revelations about Brad&#8217;s secrets were wholly unexpected, just when I thought I knew what they would be, something entirely different popped out and left me cheering the author with a well done.  This is a book and series that you will want to dive into, and not come out until it is complete: and yet there is more to come, as there are still questions to be answered.I received an eBook copy from Media Muscle for purpose of honest review.

Instead of developing an actual plot line this book basically just followed an extremely awkward (but in no way redeeming) freshman in her first year of college at Harvard.  I kept reading expecting an interesting (or at least existent) plot to develop.  But no luck.  Besides the lack of plot, I had issues with the basic writing.  The dialogue was extremely unbelievable (has the author ever heard of a contraction?) and there wasn't one likable character.  I'm really not sure how the book was even published in the first place.  I think the author might have had a good basic idea at first, but then just lost all momentum once the writing got going.   \n",

I started reading Brooks when Sword of Shannara was his only book. As an Illinois lawyer (like Brooks) of similar age, and longtime fan of Tolkien, CS Lewis, Charles Williams (and, yes, Harry Potter) I have kind of identified with Terry Brooks, and have read all the Shannara books, as well as Word/Void. Though I doubt Brooks's Word/Void series began with a conscious plan to integrate them into the beginnings of the Shannara world, I thought it was really ideal when that effort began. It became apparent in Shannara, as you went along, that its world had evolved from a post-modern apocalypse of some kind, which works well and provides a lot of food for more novels. (I've read Canticle for Liebowitz, Malevil, On the Beach, and a bunch others of that genre as well, and Shannara'a evolution from that world just began to make great sense.) So, I had huge hopes with Genesis that Brooks would link up the world of Word/Void with Shannara. I thought Bearers, and Measure, would finish what Genesis had started in doing that.  But, I thought the resolution was left incomplete. Where was this valley? There was no map included, and I could not situate its only Shannara situs, Arborlon, or exactly where in the valley Arborlon was. I was expecting an ending where Panterra and Prue would vanquish the Ragpicker demon (a masterful villain, written about brilliantly) and go off to found Paranor, and Phryne would marry Pan, abdicate, and join him there, elfstones in tow. But, alas, no Paranor, and no anything else from Shannara except for the unlocatable Arborlon. Measure had me really enthused with the love/sexual relationship (first ever for a Brooks book, I think) between Pan and Phryne. But, then she abruptly leaves him, even doubts her having loved him, and dies, leaving that unresolved, too (though her tragic flaw of impetuousness is somewhat redeemed by her heroism in saving the elves from the trolls.) But how can Phryne be queen, which I thought was going to happen, being dead? Why not at least leave her fate unknown, something for Pan (and the rest of us) to hope for. If a heroine should have died, dare I say let it have been Prue, as the ultimate sacrifice in protecting the life of the comrade whom she deeply (though maybe not yet romantically) loved? But, wasn't Sider enough? It was almost like Game of Thrones, where so many of the sympathetic characters I liked are killed off and taken away from us. Well, the lack of a resolution caused me to drop a star from the rating. Still, Measure did add some, if not enough, substance to the Word/Void - Shannara link, and did at least resolve the undead demon that stalked through from Word/Void, and Genesis, to finally, and thankfully be destroyed in this latest volume. Indeed, Measure has a lot of exciting parts, and I believe it truly merits at least 4 stars. How to fix it from here? Maybe don't leap centuries into the future in your next book, past the latest Shannara era, but bring the Hawk's valley into the Duln forests, or Leah, or somewhere in Shannara, and give us the rest of the transition, the dwarves and the gnomes, and the Southlanders, and Paranor, and link Arborlon to where it is supposed to be. Maybe you can do it through Elven diaries and histories that are somehow discovered preserved and un-decomposed. But, why not instead just add a third book to the Bearer - Measure series? Make the demon either survive in spirit to corrupt some of the Glensk Wood or other folks so that they mutate into the evil beings that Brooks created in Shannara? Lots of possibilities there. Nonetheless, Measure was still good, and deserves to be bought and will provide enjoyment when read if you are any kind of fan of Terry Brooks, and I do recommend it.   \n",

Much of the claims in this book are based on fact.  Some based on circumstantial evidence.  The circumstantial evidence is very convincing.  The bottom line ....  If I was on the jury presented with information in this book, JK would be prosecuted for treason, falsifying government documents and lending aid & comfort to the enemy, just to name a few,.  And the verdict ...  GUILTY on all counts.   \n",

As a very amateur almost beginner home cook I find it slightly intimidating though no fault of the authors. The recipes look fantastic but I'm probably quite far from executing some of them while others look possible. I have thumbed through the mother ship \"Modernist\" set and found it interesting but never bought it. I think this will suit me better. I have been building up a library of books on classical techniques from Escoffier, Pepin, and Child zooming like a Kubrickian time portal to today with this book. So it's exciting to add this to the collection. I will certainly buy a pressure cooker and learn to use it and whip dispenser. I'm not so sure on Sous Vide, something about submerging meat in water just creeps me out even though it's in a bag. There is a lot of useful information on equipment use and maximizing flavor yield that I think I could use now. I consider this a reasonably priced book considering the quality of the information, research and the book itself.   \n",

But once we find out her mother's secret, nothing happens. Aimee Bender just keeps repeating the same things she already told us. It should have been a short story not a long one and I would have given it a better rating.Although, the piece of cake on the cover is quite beautiful and lovely, but even that couldn't make this book worth more than one star.   \n",

There is actually a better translation out there by Michael Saso (which is still somewhat confusing since that's the way it was originally written).  That translation is entitled The Gold Pavilion.It's nice that this work includes the Chinese characters (the Gold Pavilion does not)...however, only one English translated word was used for each Chinese character, when actually there could be a multitude of subtle meanings.  So I think in this version, the meaning is almost completely lost.  Besides the translation itself, it seems that the authors have a hard time communicating clearly in English at all...you can see this for yourself by reading the free preview.  It takes a lot of work on behalf of the reader.However, for the diehard Taoism scholar, maybe this book contains some hidden gems.   \n",

Like all Brookner's novels, the hero/ine is solitary, well off, and given to melancholy mental soliloquies. As always, the protagonist's choice of company is unsatisfactory, the few elderly people who have sparsely peopled his past and who are egotistical, selfish and argumentative, or a 50-ish woman who loudly presents claims and demands, amply self justified, of course. So the alternatives are unfulfilling company and the demands that company makes, or isolation and solitary cogitation, indeed fear of dying alone. Brookner skillfully juxtaposes pages of inner thoughts and anxieties, long spun-out indecision, with rapid fire confrontational dialogue as the protagonist tries ineffectively to placate acquaintances who reject his politeness and counter with forthright rudeness and renewed demands. This is a longtime Brookner theme: the quiet, peaceable and well-behaved are at the mercy of charming, gregarious users, out to exploit the quiet householder, turn him out of his or her house in the guise of a short term arrangement, and extract financial advantage from the protagonist's innocent friendship. Though every novel is a variation on this theme, there is no sense of repetition. Miss Brookner's novels are each distinct, each a quiet universe of feeling, with naifs and monsters vying unequally in an indifferent London. Always there is London, bleak, chill, raining, even springtime a disappointment. The protagonist's London is always contrasted with Paris or southern France where he seeks the warm deliverance of the sun. Somehow I never find these novels depressing. Miss Brookner is master of her constricted landscape, but her bleak worldview is not for everyone.   \n",

Even past 40, I find it enjoyable. As you flip through the pages, you get the sense that you really are seeing the science of everything. The articles are short, but clear, driving home the aspect of science or of how the world works that feeds into the wonder you are looking at, be it the biology of different animals or the functioning of electronic gadgets. The book is written about three notches below Wikipedia and two notches beneath How Things Work. That makes it perfect if you're looking for understanding without getting into supplemental reading or do it yourself projects to further investigate.I'll add that I found the introduction a bit self-congratulatory and off-putting, particularly with its ode to the wonders of science posed half as rebuke to those who don't agree with scientists (not the same as science) on all matters. It was unnecessary, as the book itself conveys the wonder of the world we live in perfectly well. I offer this mainly because if you are a parent who does not accept evolution, global warming or, for that matter, the utility of GMOs, I hope you won't look at the introduction and write off a very good book for curious young minds in all other regards.   \n",

There is no meat to this storyline.  the Setup was that out of the 3 brothers this one was dangerous?  No way.  There was no passion, there was drivel.  When the hero and heroine were locked up in the mountain stronghold, I thought there was more passion between the heroine and the guy that was across the hall in the dungeon.  He turned out to be a traitor but I liked him a whole lot better than the hero.  His character was more dark and dangerous not the hero of the book.   \n",

I listened in my car and enjoyed it very much.  (We envy so many people before we know what is actually going on in their lives... Wynonna has been through so much.  I hope it will be smooth sailing for her from here on out.  I sure would never want to trade places with her).  I enjoyed this book on CD and I learned a LOT from it as well.  However it does get a tad slow in places so be prepared.   \n",

She gets dolled up (not too slutty, not too nice) and goes to the local cop bar to pick up a cop. She lucks out when she spies Rogan at the bar nursing a beer after being stood up by a buddy. Mia takes a leap (metaphorically speaking) and, after asking if he's available (no wife or girlfriend), takes the plunge and tells him a bit about her fantasy. Things get hot from there.This is one of the shortest short stories I think I've read. I call it a mini story since it's only about 18 pages long. However, don't let the lack of length put you off. Like penis size, length has very little to do with enjoyment when it's wielded with expertise and there is a lot of punch in such a short space of text. Well-written and hot, I was right there with the characters. So much so that I felt like a voyeur. *fans self*An opening was left at the end for a second installment and I'm very much looking forward to reading it.*The author provided a copy of this story to me for review.

I loved possessive and alpha male Josh. However, there was just too many pages of boring filler.   \n",

He isn't a great writer, he doesn't challenge your preconceptions, he doesn't force you to think deeply, but he is still a good writer.  He knows how to put together an interesting story, how to write characters that you can believe, how to manage plot (even if he uses the same pacing and elements every time, but so what, it works).But this novel clearly shows that he should have taken a year off.  I don't want to go so far as to compare him to Jordan when he was publishing dreck for money in the middle of his WoT series, but this comes very close to that travesty.  The publisher doesn't care because the books sell anyway, even to disappointed fans, because we know that the author has the potential to deliver an excellent novel.This book is so mediocre that the next novel will be a tipping point for me with regard to this author.  If he doesn't get back in the game, if he phones in another installment, then I will have to part ways with this series.  I really don't want that to happen.   \n",

Last I checked, you can't prove a negative...  so perhaps someday we can explain what other scientists say is impossible.  Because today, there are simply too many topics in science that we can't explain (and our best guesses are pretty poorly defined)...  This book delves into what hasn't been explained, but unfortunately, the desire to know the answers of the authors questions is a bit frustrating, because nobody knows (yet.)   \n",

I'd call it more fantasy with a light romance thread. It was an engaging story, told from the point of view of Brock, our elf hero. He's been tainted by a vampyre and must find his and his people's salvation from the curse in a witch. Brock's quest takes him all over the known world until he chances upon the woman he seeks. But his quest is thwarted by blood thirsty monks and horrid creatures.Andrea Cooper's world building is vivid and carries a hint of the Lord of the Rings to it. The romance is not as strong as most romance readers would like, but I'm not like most romance readers as I enjoy books either way.The Garnet Dagger left off with the possibility of a sequel and it'll be interesting to see where Brock and his witch have gone.I was given an ARC in exchange for a fair review.   \n",

The outcome was clear from the beginning, regardless of the evidence, or lack thereof.  The author seems to have a hard time with the English language, although he appears to be English.  I found the book hard to read and even harder to comprehend.   \n",

She's beautiful not sturdy and arrives with a mountain of luggage and fancy clothes plus a small dog named Choo-choo. Carrie falls in love with Joshua's two children but he can't believe she can be a good mother or a  good wife to him.  When he leaves her alone to think things over she proves to be a very smart woman who has the ability to make money, lots of it. When he returns and wants her back, she takes her time and with the arrival of her perfect brother Ring things get sticky.  Joshua has a lot to think about. Maybe he was too quick to judge his beautiful wife after all.   \n",

Keep it simple.  Costs more than you can realize in a return.   \n",

Does that sound strange? Often popular authors disappear, as they should. King at his best rises above the &quot;popular  author&quot; tag.The Green Mile suffers a bit from King's having to  include detail in one segment to remind readers of something in an earlier  segment. I hope someday King will do a rewrite to smooth out the  transitions.But he has seldom written better, and I was enormously  surprised. Yes, he can be uselessly crude, and he is here. But his  characters walk and talk and think and fear, here as almost always.I  have been disappointed in much of King in the past several years; most of  his writer-centered stuff just doesn't seem to work.The Green Mile works  on a number of levels, artistic, intellectual, and emotional. It's not his  best work, but it's very close.   \n",

Its focus was more on Bella and her friendship with Jacob who has his own set of issues to deal with.What I didn't care for with New Moon was the fact that they downplayed the suicide attempt. Teen suicide is a very serious topic and it was glossed over like it didn't matter.  I also didn't care for the lack of caring for existence Bella and Edward had.I think Bella was shown to be needy and a little mentally unstable in certain parts of this book.  I was a little disappointed with the turn of her life in this book.The story dragged in some areas and it was a little redundant in certain parts of the book.  But the overall book was well written and edited.  I enjoyed the book even though I did have  few issues with subject matter.I found the additional characters introduced in this book a welcome pleasure and I can't wait to read more about them in future books. Once again the character development was really good.  Bella's unusual strength against Vampires is something I am really looking to learning more about and that was delved into more in this book.The book was really good and I definitely think people of all ages should give it a chance and read it.  But make sure you read the first book Twilight first or you could get a little lost in the back story.   \n",

But if for one person's whim can be a blackout and keep Vegas without water, I think that the State of Nevada has a very BIG problem as well as the whole country. If one simple woman thinks that she can do whatever she wants to Las Vegas's mob and get away with it... as it happened in the book... I think I better read Cinderella. It's more plausible.   \n",

I am ashamed to admit that I had no idea that Egypt was so oppressive!I read this book to learn about Egyptian culture and to sample their experience in America.  This book did that for me, so I learned a lot.  If that is your reason for reading it as well, you will be very satisfied. If you want merely entertainment, look elsewhere.  This book is more than that.Keep in mind that the author is a dentist in Cairo, Egypt who studied dentistry in Chicago.  He continues to be a dentist to keep up with society.  I feel like Alaa Al Aswany is capable of shedding light on Egyptian culture and criticism of his Egyptian characters is unwarranted unless you too are from the Middle East.It is more of a set of short stories than I expected.  I found the Arab names hard to remember.  For the first half of the book I had to look back and recall which character belonged to which name.  Alaa Al Aswany develops the characters fully (about 1/2 of the book is devoted to character development) before moving more into their stories.I found the book easy to read if you consider sentence structure and vocabulary.  It was hard to read the first 1/2 only because you to do not get attached to the characters for a until the latter half.  I found it laborious to read but I am thankful I stuck it out.  I felt like I knew the characters intimately when their stories did progress.(I am going to leave out spoilers)There was an Egyptian with an American wife and daughter.  His daughter gets involved with immoral activity.  You get to watch his reaction as he deals with things especially shocking for an Egyptian male.There is a dating couple considering marriage but tempted into making love.  They struggle to do what is acceptable to her parents back in Egypt.The President of Egypt visits Chicago and some characters create plans to promote democracy during his visit.There is a Christian Egyptian who struggles with accusations of abandoning his homeland.There is a couple in which the husband is looking to be promoted within the Egyptian government.The end came with several shocks/surprises that I did not see coming.   \n",

In short, Kagan is nostalgic for a circumstance dependent on unnatural conditions (unless, of course, he has decided that War is *healthy*, part of the natural order of things ..).  His call for the U.S. to assume global leadership is all well and good, but it tends to assume strange forms, such as attacking secular leaders in the Islamic world: Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi, President Assad.  One of Kagan's ideological soul-mates, Michael Ledeen, has openly declared that it's not in America's interest to have stability in that part of the world, that instability should be sown whenever possible.  I disagree with that assessment .. and using Kagan's formula - which includes supporting Saudi ideological imperialism - the end result is the rest of the world rooting for the downfall of the United States (a nation-state currently propped up by the military and its dominance of global financial institutions).  The U.S. can either become part of the emerging global economy or risk becoming irrelevant (see also \"the Portuguese Empire\").   \n",

No waiting for coals or wood to get hot, no ashes to dump...This Weber book isn't an all encompassing book like some of the other Weber books.  At just over 200 pages it's rather slight actually.  It gives just over a 100 recipes, more or less a sampling of what you can do on your gas grill rather than a bible type tome.  Tips are provided with colorful illustrations demonstrating direct and indirect cooking methods, as well as options for smoking and adding a rotisserie.  From there you get into the meat of the book (pun intended) and some very nice recipes.  Honestly a lot the recipes don't seem like \"guy\" type dishes.  I mean I can't see the average backyard cook making Prosciutto wrapped Shrimp for example.  It may be quite good but it's not my cup of tea.  I'd prefer some more stick to your rips type of recipes.  I did find a few so far that I did like...The Mediterranean Flank Steak is good.  I prefer it on a crusty italian roll rather than a pita, though.  The filet mignon with shoestring potatoes was great.  Filet Mignons are some of my favorite things to make on my grill.All in all, this book provides some interested deviations from typical grill fare so if that's what your're looking for this is a great book for you.   \n",

Anne Rice uses this historical period to write a compelling story of one family whose lives are played out against this unique societal tapestry.While today with our contemporary views we may find this societal tapestry difficult to understand, it is certainly worth reading about for the insights into the peculiar situation for free mulatto and quadroon women in New Orleans before the Civil War.  And while we may not be able to agree with some of the actions of the main characters, I felt those actions were believable in light of this story.I watched the DVD of the film version later, and while interesting, it lacks the insights that the book has.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller   \n",

What more could you ask for? A couple of days after reading it, I had to go back and re-read bits of it, just to make sure I understood what was going on. There are a lot of wait-a-minute moments, where everything you've assumed up to that point gets yanked out from under you. A word of warning, though: If you like stories with a nice, neat, happily-ever-after ending, you'll probably have a problem with this book.   \n",

You fall for the bad guy, our hero but alas the substance of the text is lacking some what. Such a shame this relationship had promise.   \n",

It's got a decent idea, and might be fun. But the constant spelling mistakes, and use of distracting phrases kills the writing flow.In addition:Characters appear and make grandiose statements, then disappear with \"other important things to attend to\".The main schoolyard drama between the main character and his antagonists develops over 3 encounters from \"I just met you and you're annoying\" to \"I'm now going to destroy you\". 3 encounters does not constitute plot development.Whenever a supporting character tells your main character he's \"almost like a god\", you may be...no, you ARE going a bit overboard as an author.After reading the entire book (expecting it to somehow get better) I'm still not sure what the rules for magic are, or how \"Vorms\" work at all.Seems like a first effort; needs cleaning up.   \n",

EJ is a damaged woman, damaged by her mother who was too busy with her career and herself to be A mother.  Jess is a self-proclaimed angel who decides that EJ needs her specialized angel-type help.  She kidnaps EJ and takes her back to Washington for the eighth wedding of EJ's mother, and then the sparks fly!  I did not give this book 5 stars because 1) the slow start, and more importantly 2) the inserts of Lilly's (EJ's mother) writing which, although I got used to it and found it mildly interesting, was totally superfluous to the story.  Most of these ebooks could use some good editing.   \n",

Still, in no way was my lack of experience with the author a bar to my enjoyment of The Death of Santini: The Story of a Father and His Son.I found this book to be very mature and very stimulating; as someone who has lost both parents, I found it very personally resonant in several key respects. However, there were some elements of Conroy's story I didn't find relatable personally, and to some extent that hindered my enjoyment of the book. It was also longer than I would have liked, but it's understandably hard to exclude things when one is dealing with such personal matters.I'd recommend this book to anyone who finds it productive to think about how our families make us who we are. I think you'll be touched by Pat Conroy's journey.Please be advised I got a free advance reader's copy through Goodreads Giveaways.   \n",

Once this military merchant tastes \"blood-money\" he rises like a seven headed vampire willing to suck the\" blood-money\" from the US Treasury. Vilify the enemy as terrorist and then kill them with impunity under the cover a spreading \"Democracy\".  We must remember Europe plundered Africa under the cover of spreading Christianity to the uncivilized natives - AMEN!Blackwater is also a look into the mind-set of the advocates for smaller non-intrusive government. However, those advocates only want government to outsource their work including military duties. Mercenaries are not new for US military; they come in different forms depending on the location. It is just mind boggling that right wing Christian ideology and American patriotism are fused by these groups with a mind-set to use military force to kill human beings, as if they got a mandate to help their god and country. This is the same ideological paradigm as any right wing god helping sect.Blackwater has placed a face on those  Christian right wing fear-mongers, and their sources of funding and methods and strategies used to support right winged politics and benefit from government contracts. These money grubbing \"god-helpers\" are skewed in one direction and have little real godliness.   \n",

good book but just about the worst proofread one I've ever seen. The author should have her pencil broken or learn to use a good proofer.   \n",

They are all coming of age. It is a summer of discovery for all of them which continues through the following decades that they remain in touch.It begins in the summer of 1974. Julie's father has just passed away, at the untimely age of 42. When she receives a scholarship to attend the camp, Spirit in the Woods, her mom decides it would be good for her to go. While there, she flourishes. When some teens get together in a camp tepee and decide to form a group that will continue to be best friends forever, into the future, she is flattered to be invited to attend; Ash and Goodman, (sister and brother), Jonah, Kathy, Ethan (an animation genius) and Julie, the newbie, round out the circle of six. When they call her Jules, she adopts the name ever after. She does comedy routines at camp and comes out of her shell. She and Ash remain best friends into adulthood and all of them remain friends, throughout the years, periodically getting together again. For the most part, they support each other and are positive influences in each other's lives.The story follows these characters from the summer of Nixon's resignation to the ten year anniversary of 9/11, when they are in their fifties. Each of their lives plays out in a different direction. They remain friends all through the ensuing years, some becoming more successful than others. Each finds their own way. Two of them marry, one is gay, one accuses another of rape, one marries someone outside the circle (Dan), and one runs off and assumes another identity in order to escape the errors of his ways. All of them are fully formed, and we live with them, their failures, successes, mistakes and conflicts as they age and face the exigencies of life.There is some crude language and also there are unnecessary sex scenes which add nothing to the story's development. From my perspective, relevant and important subjects, like intermarriage, motherhood, parental death, divorce, separation, the Aids epidemic, premarital sex, drug use, and even autism, are only casually referenced and not fully explored, while, at the same time, largely irrelevant, liberal political views run rampant, throughout the text, at every opportunity. Wealth and the evil it spawns, coupled with its alter ego, privation, a problem apparently caused by the rich, in the author's view, are mentioned as well. (The expression of the author's personal political views seems to be a very common theme running through the novels today. Authors seem to want to express their personal views and not so subtly plant references to them.)The story is sometimes repetitious as it is retold from different character's points of view as events play out.These are not perfect characters; they have flawed families and imperfect lives, with all of the sundry normal problems and not so normal ones in evidence. They have emotional trauma, mental and physical issues and even legal problems to deal with at various points of the narrative. All of the themes are knitted together in the end when the story comes full circle. There are villains and heroes.In the end, it is about life changes and changing needs as we age. It is about money and the lack of it, what money can buy and what money can destroy. It is about beauty and the lack of it. It is about the relevancy and irrelevancy of issues that sometimes seem so important at one stage of life and so trivial at another. Still, sometimes it takes almost a lifetime to work out the effects of some events in our lives, in order to move forward and live again. Life isn't fair and it isn't a fairy tale. It is not for sissies.Absent the political bias which flies off the pages expressing the author's dislike of conservative politics, it is a really \"interesting\" study of a group of teens as they grow and mature, learn how to make choices, some good and some bad, and come to realize that being \"interesting\" is in the eye of the beholder and its importance depends on circumstances and moments in time. There are many poignant moments, and moments of truth, witnessed by the reader for each of the characters. In the end, most of the characters are altruistic and soon discover that money does not always lift up the rich, but often corrupts them. It is a person's behavior, hopes and dreams that define them, not their money or position or their popularity and beauty.   \n",

I began reading it, thinking I was getting a Fox News type of promised \"fair and balanced\" discussion, but I finished my reading with the realization that I had been snookered by a very unfair and unbalanced set of arguments.Mr. Crescenzi has some good points and he presents our sovereign and personal debt problems in some creative and meaningful ways, using phrases such as  \"The biggest Ponzi Scheme in History\", \"Age Warfare\", \"How Fiscal Illusions and Public Unions Ballooned our Debts\",  \"The Hypnotic Power of Debt\", and \"The 30 Year American Consumption Binge\"!Unfortunately (at least for the concept of \"fair and balanced\"), he totally seems to have forgotten our profligate MILITARY spending problem,  wherein in the last decade we've spent trillions of dollars (not just hundreds of billions) on largely wasted military actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.In fact our absurd military spending (note that we spend more on our military than all other nations combined, spend), and our military lobbying, tax breaks, etc., represent the military establishment's own variation on the Ponzi Scheme concept (with future taxpayers having to pay the prior military bills).I can only guess as to why the author went after the elderly, the American \"debt weakness\", the public and private unions, etc., while he totally omitted any discussion of the far greater military spending sources of our debt load. Hopefully he will explain this to us, the readers, so that we may feel he was more \"fair and balanced\" than he appears in this book.   \n",

The author did a unremarkable job with the writing style of this story I couldn't have been more happy to read another one from her. This was not only just a love story it was about people finding their true happiness and over-coming all their demons inside. And on that journey falling in love which was a plus if you ask me, It all worked out in the end.***I received this story for free in exchange for an honest review, see more of my review @ [...]   \n",

From the very first appearance of Spidey's black costume during the Secret War (the first and best) to a genuine knock-down-drag-out battle involving Venom and Spider-Man, this collection has a good start. Keep in mind though, it's only a start.If you already own the collection \"Spiderman Versus Venom\", you don't really need this one. There are several crossover issues from both books. And Venom really doesn't play a strong part until about halfway through this collection. We do get a lot of backstory about how the symbiote costume started controlling Peter and how he ultimately rid himself of it before it joined with Eddie Brock. To me, though, Eddie Brock's Venom makes the whole thing worth it. This was before he became the tamer, good guy version of himself later in the comics. This was Eddie when all he wanted to do was eat Spider-Man's liver and such. He was a genuinely scary villain, and probably the best foe Spidey faced during the 90's.I have no doubt there will be a volume 2 of this coming out later because of the abrupt end we have. Don't get me wrong, the story is finished, but there was a lot more history between these two later on.Again, a great collection to get you the Venom backstory. Just remember you'll be flipping quite a few pages before he actually shows up.   \n",

I liked the three main characters, I wish the perspective had been shared though, Evan and Rai were a bit flat. The others in the story were great, I loved Denise and Stella. Also Liam and Shannon. The relationship developed nicely between the three of them, the sex was hot, but was a bit much. Not much goes on between them that we see other than sex, a trip to a boot sale, a game, and a couple of meals. I liked Rai's owl obsession, and Evan's patient acceptance of it. Josh was a sweet blushing addition to their relationship.The story rolled along just fine, then BAM! It ended. I'm not really sure what happened, it just ended. Nothing about Josh giving Evan and Rai his gifts, nothing more about the other characters, or the glass shop, it just abruptly ended.Still a good read, I'd buy another from Josephine!   \n",

It is filled with beautiful color pictures which is nice but the information is all extremely simple and not helpful at all.Disney is very expensive but certainly a worthwhile trip.  It is very necessary to do a lot of research before planning to get the most for your buck and from your trip.  I highly recommend THE UNOFFICIAL GUIDE TO WALT DISNEY WORLD and the PASSPRTER GUIDE for extensive research, guidance on everything needed to plan an amazing trip.For pictures of what you will see when there get this book.  For me it ruins the surprises and some of the memories I want to make on my own.Disney is truly magical and shop wisely for the necessary guide books.   \n",

According to the author's note at the end, there are more installments coming, and I can see him gaining quite the fan following.  I want to give a word of warning though: Old World begins as a fairly standard zombie narrative, but it takes a turn into pure horror that won't be for everyone.The story begins with the Lochlears, a family which has survived the viral zombification of nearly all of the population of England, and the first few chapters introduce us to them and how they are surviving post-zombie apocalypse. They are a nice family, but they've been reduced to survivalism and brutal killing at a moment's notice in order to survive. It's a really interesting premise - trying to be a family while having to give up one's humanity, and the smooth, clear prose makes it quick, interesting reading. This beginning section fits in with the same kind of world as The Walking Dead, and it all seems fairly normal for zombie lit. When the glimmer of other survivors appears, the family hit the road in hope, and that is when the novella takes a distinct turn into truly nasty horror. I didn't see It coming and was pretty shocked. It's not my cup of tea, but Oliver Kennedy controls the scenes well; I just didn't have the stomach for this level of gruesome. I'm not sure it was all necessary, either, but for this style of horror the writing is very strong, and I can see Kennedy is taking the ideas somewhere very interesting. I just might be too faint of heart to follow!   \n",

abrupt.  I loved the book though it was really a great story there where some grammar errors but not so many that it distract from the book.   \n",

Even when the plot is weak, Chet is always good for a laugh.  Fortunately for fans of the series, this is one of Quinn's better books.A movie is shooting on location in the Valley.  The mayor (prompted by the city's insurance company) hires Bernie to keep an eye on the star.  Thad Perry has a taste for drugs and a knack for getting into trouble.  If the three weeks of filming pass without incident, the town will attract more filmmakers -- or so the mayor believes -- and the city's insurer won't have to pay any claims. Yet once filming begins, trouble of an unexpected nature ensues:  murder.  In the end, three murders come to light (albeit considerably separated in time) and it's up to Bernie and Chet to determine how they are related. Bernie is in charge of deduction; Chet (as he frequently reminds the reader) brings other things to the table.The mystery is a good one, much better than the plot that drove theprevious novelin the series.  Still, the story exists largely as an excuse to give Chet something to talk about.  Chet is the narrator and, as you might expect of a dog, he has trouble staying focused.  Chet's thoughts tend to meander (often in the direction of his next meal) but they always end up in a happy place.  Chet might ponder a profound question for a few moments -- If Bernie has a word on the tip his tongue, why can't Chet see it? How can Bernie's bark be worse than his bite when Bernie doesn't bark? -- but Chet doesn't sweat the small stuff.  His running commentary on life (\"a fluffy white towel can be fun to drag around\") is hilarious.Like all dogs, Chet enjoys eating (ribs are a favorite), napping, and riding in cars.  He has some impulse control issues, particularly when cats are around, but the beauty of Quinn's writing lies in his illumination of the canine mind.  Bernie might think Chet is misbehaving, but Chet's behavior is perfectly natural ... to Chet.  Whether he's shredding the leather seats in Bernie's new Porsche or making an uninvited leap into someone's swimming pool, Chet's actions always make perfect sense ... to Chet.A Fistful of Collars moves at a steady pace and features enough action and detection to satisfy mystery and light thriller fans, but the story is clearly geared to dog lovers.  This is neither a hardcore thriller nor a complex mystery.  The writing is breezy, the language is clean, and humor (invariably generated by Chet's antics and commentary) is the animating force.  New readers can enjoy the story even if they haven't read the earlier installments, but series fans will appreciate the mild intrigue surrounding Bernie's changing relationship with his girlfriend.  Chet doesn't quite understand what that's all about, while readers will have to wait for the next book to learn how Bernie's romantic life will unfold.  Until then, Bernie at least has Chet at his side.If I could, I would give A Fistful of Collars 4 1/2 stars.   \n",

I was afraid that the rest of the characters would be as unrelatable, but fortunately those fears were unfounded. The premise of the novels -- the marriage of man and alternate reality technology -- was well thought out with all its implications. It simultaneously captures the wonder of what could be possible with such technology, and serves as a cautionary tale. That is a mark of excellent science fiction. I found myself liking the work more and more as I continued to read and now I am looking forward to future installments.   \n",

It was his first day at school and he wanted to set of  the fire alarm. But he was to scared bc he might get caught or something. But he had a crush on this girl. So she asked him to eat with her and the boy said ok. So they went to eat lunch and they had a good time together. After the boy was telling his friend Leo about what he did with the girl. So after he and his friend both had a good time. But I don't feel the rest of the story. . So if you read this, this is part of it.   \n",

long enough to finish it. The more I read the more I became involved with the characters. It reminded me of what's important in life.   \n",

Good indexing systems not only store page 'numbers' (specific sites) but also 'locations' within the pages. Thus, one can find a phrase query hit by only looking at a few lines in an index rather than reading through large numbers of web pages. This also easily allows NEAR queries (eg. w/i 5 words of each other), an important component for ranking.The 'rank' of a page turns on relevance, and where query words occur near each other they're more likely to be relevant. HTML uses 'metawords' indicating eg. 'title start,' 'title end' that allow search engines to further improve rankings via explicit consideration of titles.Hyperlinks are phrases on a web page that take one to another page when clicked on - usually highlighted in blue. The number of hyperlinks can be used for ranking, though they can't distinguish between good and bad references within the linked material. The number of pages linked to a particular sources provides a measure of authority. (MacCormick then refers to the 'random surfer' trick to handle circularity.) Unfortunately, people can abuse the hyperlink trick to artificially inflate the ranking of their own web pages by creating large numbers of web pages linking to them, but MacCormick doesn't explain how good search engines discount these. Google now uses over 200 signals in page ranking.Public Key cryptography with 128-bit encryption uses a 38-digit number as it key. In addition, long messages are broken up into small 'blocks' of fixed size, usually 10-15 characters, and each block is then transformed ten or more times per complex rules. The most popular block cipher now is AES.The Diffie-Hellman key exchange system sets up the key for stranger exchanges using prime numbers. Such a system is used whenever a site starts with 'https' instead of 'http.' MacCormick first uses a simplified example involving paint colors to introduce the concepts.Then its on to other subjects. Again, well-done, though not always easy reading.   \n",

It brought out my anxiety. Any mother would be anxious as she reads this!This is in the author's country, Canada. It isn't over emphasized but makes you want to go there. It sounds like it must be absolutely beautiful!This is about the kidnapping, torturing, dismembering and killing of children, which makes it a book I will never read again. I will forever have nightmares from this!The main character's son has a disability. He is unable to speak. Yes, you do find out why.Ghosts waft about and take over at times, be prepared. As usual, they need help.Yes, I read this with text-to-speech on my Kindle.I don't usually read mysteries, neither do I read books that will keep me awake or cause nightmares. The author leaves all the clues you need to solve the mystery. You do see it coming. Even still, as gruesome as this mystery is, you keep reading in hopes of closure for the poor mother who has been through enough.Strong fem. She just doesn't know it. She hides from her own strength in her alcohol. But when she is more sober, facing her demons, so-to-speak, you know that any person would want to escape this mess, any way they could.If I were into crime mysteries I think I would give this five stars. I prefer books like Cheryl Kaye Tardif's Whale Song.   \n",

She had an almost insatiable hunger for love combined with ridiculous taste in men. She had a short attention span. She was, as Brown points out again and again, \"a tactician,\" who often exhibited reckless disregard for the long-term consequences of her actions. All true.And yet, even after all this is disclosed, the woman we see is am ambitious, empathic woman, a mother who loves her sons, and a charismatic force of nature with a nearly undefeatable spirit. I don't know if it's Brown's writing or the power of Diana's personality that make her someone you root for, even as she races toward that sad end in Paris.My biggest quibble with the book is NOT ENOUGH PHOTOS. Over and over, Brown makes reference to this iconic photograph, or to that famous dress she wore, or how Diana's style changed to reflect her evolving personality ... and it would be nice if those photos were included in the book. I found this frustrating.   \n",

Sweet and adorable will most likely be the first two words to pop into any reader's head whenever their thoughts turn to Nichole Chase's latest YA novel. Meena lives in the Bahamas with her adopted parents, helping them run their animal shelter, Flukes. Since she's been home schooled her whole life, her biggest worries aren't bullies or boys, but the secret she's hiding. That dynamic changes the moment she meets Blake. Blake is assigned to work at Flukes because of an incident that leaves community service as his only option if he wants to receive his high school diploma. While Meena may believe that staying away from Blake will protect her secret, she learns that maybe her secret isn't in too much danger with him.Flukes flows at a very quick pace filling readers up with romance and mysticism. Blake and Meena ruled this story and every moment that Chase spends on their growing relationship is well spent. However, for readers who love the catch of suspense and strong hints of danger, Flukes doesn't have much of either. The limited amount of conflict in the plot gives the story a breezy feeling, as if anything bad that might happen will be very easy to overcome. Out of the whole novel there's just two or three scenes that provide real conflict in either Meena or Blake's lives and they're short-lived or too simple. The impact could have been much greater on the intensity of the plot, if Chase expounded when it came to relating the issues to readers.Meena's sweetness coupled with Blake's protectiveness takes the novel's romance to a warm, cherishing level. Chase's characters are strong and humorous, giving Flukes a lightness that will make readers sigh with contentment throughout the story.*ebook provided in exchange for an honest review*   \n",

I was looking forward to reading this, but came away in dismay. The author profiles each of the Bonds, and does offer up tidbits of production information. The interviews (most of which seem to be several years old) with each actor seem interesting enough- Timothy Dalton's commentary is most enlightening of those interview transcripts. Still, the vast majority of the book amounts to little more than detailed film summaries. Most Bond fans have either seen each of the films or know enough about them that they don't need summaries. In the end, the impression is that the reader feels disappointed.   \n",

The writing's fairly taut and fresh and the plot cracks along but the modern tone, though justified by the surprise plot twist at the end, seems remarkably out of place. We get a fairly good tour of the English (and Welsh) countryside as our reluctant viking protagonist learns to raid and kill in the best tradition of his forebears, gets lost from his raiding party and hooks up with a lovely, if mysterious, female companion and finally finds his shipmates again, only to get swept overboard, with the girl, and end up in the monastery at Lindisfarne just prior to the historical raid on that site which kicked off the full scale viking age in England -- which was to trouble the natives there for the next hundred years or so. We get an oddly bracing picture of these vikings too, professional warriors that they were, as they ready themselves for each upcoming encounter (not unlike the limbering-up exercises of a modern football team about to meet the \"other side\" out on the gridiron in a friendly match) -- you almost have to believe in the realism of it all, despite the warm fuzzy feeling you get once you've really gotten to know these boys. Even Thorfinn Skullsplitter seems like the kind of guy you wouldn't mind splitting a beer with -- assuming that's all he's in the mood for cleaving. But the dragon stuff seems rather forced and out of place. And the end, clever as it is, only adds to the sense that this book and this author didn't quite know where they wanted to go with the story. The protagonist's \"voice\" lapses into a rather sophomoric, counter-cultural patois as the tale winds down, which is both jarring and debilitating to the rest of the tale. And, though it's justified by the ending, the ending itself is discordant with what went before. You may guess it from the way the story moves, but I doubt you'll figure out the locale.The surprise ending in this one seems to have pleased many readers but I found it a bit off-putting, myself, turning what had seemed to me to be a good, and nicely paced, historical yarn into something a bit too self-concious and cute. I prefer my viking tales with a larger dash of authenticity so the abrupt plot twist which brings this one to a close, left me a bit cold.But it's nicely written and holds the reader to the end.SWM   \n",

I could have done without the constant ruminations by Cal about his hopeful love life and past which took up way too much space and detracted from the story. Enjoyed the short chapters.   \n",

It still holds up! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I could tell who would end up with whom early on, and it seems they jump in bed without really considering what they are doing...just &#34;scratch the itch&#34;.

their life.It's a fast read and very thoughtprovoking.The only thing I did not like was the use of the New Century and Messenger Bibles.   \n",

I finally succumbed and bought Spider's Bite. Unfortunately, I was right. It wasn't for me.Strong characters, lots of action, impressive world building and some sexual tension - but I couldn't get past the level of violence.It's funny. GA Aiken's Dragon series is violent, but I adjusted to that. Perhaps because it's tempered with humour and love and family.Spider's Bite was just too strong for me. But if you're not freaked by a bit of blood and revenge, I can see why this series has its committed fans.   \n",

Besides, I want to make this spoiler-free.A few have mentioned the improvement in Butcher's writing, but I still have to chime in on that.  In his first books, he was a good but not great author - unsurprising given that they were his first published works.  What sets Butcher apart to me is that where many in contemporary publishing start to decline noticeably in the quality of their writing after gaining some success, he hasn't.  In point of fact, he's clearly been working to improve every aspect of his storytelling.Take any component of a good tale - characterization, character development, relationships, dialogue, plot structure and complexity, world-building, internal consistency, and just the craft of creating prose that leads a reader through a series of ideas, thoughts, events in order to build to a conclusion not just of plot but of an IDEA - Jim Butcher has now shown he is capable of doing all of these and doing them well.Without delving into spoilers, the last novel in the series,Changes: A Novel of the Dresden Files, contained Many Significant Events and also illuminated the significance of previous events in new ways.  By the end of the novel, the world the characters lived in had been utterly transformed.This novel was about many things, but the one that stands out above the rest is consequences, using the aftermath of the previous novel as the driving force behind the idea.  Obvious, perhaps, but Butcher comes at it from different directions, giving more depth to it than just a sort of \"A Christmas Carol\" or \"Its a wonderful life\" approach, I thought.I cannot recommend this book strongly enough.  Be warned however, that much of what is to be absorbed from it would be lost without reading the earlier works, preferably in order from book one,Storm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1).  There is a story arc to the Dresden Files and one would be doing oneself a real disservice to read them out of order.   \n",
            "117  For those who complain that McMurtry's STREETS OF LAREDO didn't have the same feel as LONESOME DOVE, it's a legitimate critique, but it's also one that misses the point.STREETS OF LAREDO is by far a more effective, chilling and worthy book than any of the prequels that McMurtry would later pen about Gus and Call's earlier days (all of them enjoyable reads...but none of them ever managed to recapture the magice of LONESOME DOVE).As far as I'm concerned STREETS OF LAREDO is one of the most terrifying books I've ever read. Some of the scenes of brutality and cruelty are tons more frightening and nightmarish than anything ever penned by Stephen King.LONESOME DOVE...though, no doubt, filled with a gritty realism that has often been lacking in Westerns (either on film or in literature)...did still convey some sense of romance to the Western. Even though LONESOME DOVE is in a leagure of its own, one can still see homage being paid to classics such as RED RIVER, THE GUNFIGHTER, THE COWBOYS and THE SEARCHERS both on page and on film.STREETS OF LAREDO strips away the romance and paints a picture of a dying era.The likes of Woodrow and his peers have become so scarce that it's gotten to the point where a hero such as Charles Goodnight will pause in the desert to have a conversation with a human monster such as John Wesley Hardin (a chilling scene in STREETS OF LAREDO that's akin to the Angel Gabriel and Lucifer meeting face to face).STREETS OF LAREDO is in the same league as the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone or more brutal Westerns such as Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH (and even shares a bit with the theme of the more low-key homage to the dying West that's depicted in THE SHOOTIST). If LONESOME DOVES had its share of heroes who seem bigger than life, STREETS OF LAREDO shares all the grotesque qualities of a Leone Western by filling its landscape with characters barely worthy of life. Disurbingly nightmarish places such as Crow Town in STREETS OF LAREDO would not be at all out of place in one of Leone's MAN WITH NO NAME(Clint Eastwood) TRILOGY.What's especially brilliant about STREETS OF LAREDO is that McMurtry builds up such a grand landscape with so many rich characters in LONESOME DOVE...only to tear apart that terrain, its heroes and its nobility with his sequel. It is a jarring book, for sure. Even though LONESOME DOVE is not without its disturbing & brutal moments, there is a nobility to many of the scenes and characters (which is why it's so well-loved...and will continue to be well-loved for many, many decades). Yet, to make sur that we're not too smitten or swept away by the grandeur of LONESOME DOVE, McMurtry delivered STREETS OF LAREDO as a way of showing us the dark underbelly of the beast that we didn't completely see in LONESOME DOVE. Without Gus riding by Woodrow's side, Captain Call has become every bit as much a shell of a man as Eastwood in the Leone movies (or in UNFORGIVEN). It is not easy to read...and perhaps McMurtry would have left many readers much more happy had he let the LONESOME DOVE saga end with that one book. However, by writing STREETS OF LAREDO McMurty provides the hangover that comes after a night of drunken revalry. It's not an easy read...it strips away the myth & awe that LONESOME DOVE provided to so many...but it is brilliant.With those two books (LONESOME DOVE and STREETS OF LARED0), McMurty managed to go from conjuring up the spirit of John Ford/Howard Hawks to evoking the demons of Leon/Peckinpah.In many ways one could draw a parallel to this pair of books to THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER PART II. Though both GODFATHER films are brutal, one shows the rise of a glorious America...while the other shows its fall (all through the character of Michael Corleone). McMurtry accomplishes the same with LONESOME DOVE (the more glorious time) and STREETS OF LAREDO (the fall of such glory).I mean, finding out within the first dozen pages or so that Newt was killed shortly after the story of LONESOME DOVE ends...that pretty much let the reader know from the word \"go\" that we'd be in for a dark ride with this book.If LONESOME DOVE...even amidst the betrayals, the murders, the senseless killings, the dirt and the grime...managed to speak to the better angels within us, the STREETS OF LAREDO speaks to our demons. With this in mind, I find these two books to complete and complement one another. STREETS OF LAREDO, by its very dark/dim nature, manages to exalt LONESOME DOVE even more.While LONESOME DOVE, through its sweeping majesty, manages to make STREETS OF LAREDO all the more disturbing.As for the other books with Gus & Call...they are entertaining at best... but none of the prequels ever come close to accomplishing the jarring dichotomy that McMurty accomplishes with his pairing of LONESOME DOVE and STREETS OF LAREDO.So, for those who are disappointed or disturbed by STREETS OF LAREDO...I'd suggest that you put a few CDs of Ennio Morricone's Western Themes on the stereo to play in the background while giving this book another reading. You might find that it's in the same league as LONESOME DOVE itself when read this way.   \n",

Although I would swear that when I first downloaded this \"book\" it was 25kb and it was just called \"On Gratitude.\"  Now it's called \"On Gratitude; Alicia Keys\" and it's listed at 15kb in size.If nothing else, it looks like Amazon heard the complaints and decided to make some changes to the title.   \n",

Seems like old plots from the previous Malory's were reused.  If this had been the first Malory novel I had read then it would have also been the last.  JL seems to be propping the last 2 Malory stories up with the more lovable Malory characters.  I think there would have been a better way to go with Jeremy's story; as with Derek's story, James and Tony seemed to be the hero's.  I would like to see a book for Drew Anderson but not if he can't stand on his own. I was so hoping Jeremy's story would come about from a bet with his cousin Amy.  Jeremy used to be a lovable rake; in this book he didn't seem like a rake at all. Kinda boring.  Wasn't really thrilled with Danny either.   \n",

There is a clearly defined mythology, religion, political system, philosophy and ecology in this world.  Despite all the introduced terminology in the book, I feel it is easy enough for the reader to pick up and understand these new terms.Having said that, I did not find the main characters, or many of the other characters, interesting.  Paul and Jessica are unappealing characters because of their seeming penchant for all of their actions to be based on political reasons.  While there is a need for it at times, it seems like all of their actions are made for manuvering their survival on Arrakis.  I feel that the better characters are Gurney Halleck and Dr. Yueh.  Both men have detailed backstories that fully explain their motivations in the actions they take, which are made for a myriad of reasons, not just political.I felt that the book would have benefitted from more of a balance between action and political intrigue.  The action sequences that did take place were ok, and would have kept my interest more.I realize that I am in the minority with my opinion of Dune.  I give Herbert a lot of credit for creating a fully imagined and detailed world, and this novel was no doubt groundbreaking at the time of publication.  For me, the book would have benefitted more if the same detail had been paid to his characterizations.   \n",

Ya know, wondering if the story would linger in my thoughts.  It did, which is why I gave it four stars instead of three.  But even though I'm giving it four stars, this book has an equal amount of pros and cons.  I'll start with the cons.1. Way too much internal dialogue--the babble dragged on and on.  Tru is constantly hashing over her blasted feelings, repeating the same thoughts throughout.  I would've enjoyed more actual dialogue between the characters or just edit it out all together.  I skipped countless paragraphs of insignificant mind chatter.2.  A bit juvenile at times with the love triangle scenes.  The bar scene with Will, Tru, and Jake is of a high school mindset.  I know Towle was trying not to depicted Tru as a callous harlot, but the way she lied to Will and her reasoning behind it was just ... well ... straight out of high school.3.  The name The Mighty Storm.  I kept thinking about the Christopher Guest mockumentary, A Mighty Wind.  Hilarious movie but I didn't want to associate it with a sexy rockstar romance.Pros:1.  Towle can write a solid love story and create an alluring lead man, or should I say, lead rockstar.  Jake was a hotty, and I fell hard for this sexy piece of guitar-playing-ass.  Although Tru, IMO, comes across as the two-timing tramp at times, I liked her too.  I was cheering the couple on from the get go.2.  Dialogue.  I wanted more of it!!  I loved the exchanges between Tru and Jake.  Their conversations made me blush, giggle with anticipation, shed a tear (from anger and joy), and feel strongly connected to both. This is why the book lingered in my thoughts--great exchanges between the pair.3.  The famous rockstar premise has a provocative draw--I enjoyed getting sucked into their world.  It was fun escapism!   \n",

Here we have a Lizzy and Darcy who are deeply in love from the beginning and the author creates obstacles and situations to which there was an obvious solution all along. All the text in between is just filler going around in circles.As a non-vampire fan who bought this on impulse, a lot still confuses me after the book ended and the author makes no attempt to explain or resolve the issue. For example, aren't people bound to notice that the Lizzy and Darcy aren't getting any older as the years pass? How are they planning to explain this? Even the supernatural realm has to be grounded in some sort of logic.Other reviewers have complained that the book was too short. I'm not adding my voice to theirs. I'm actually glad it didn't go on any longer. This was my first and last sojourn into the vampire camp. I'm glad I didn't spend more or have to read longer.   \n",

I really didn't like the first 2 books. I thought Barb was a total jellyfish who I wanted to punch in the face. Boohoo, your husband left. Get a spine . Be brave for your kids. Then, later in book 1, she got a bit better. Book 2 was still a lot of insecurities but she did better. Books 3 and 4 were much better. Better plot twists, characters had much more depth. Story line was much better.If you really didn't care for the first book, I would say to stick it out until the end.I don't think old Barb is an annoying wet noodle anymore. :)   \n",

I enjoyed it, but it wasn't like I wanted to stay up all night reading it. It really had no point to it other than get drunk and find love, but then get rid of it? I liked it and I hope I like the movie as well   \n",

It's an easy read, but it reads more like a poor attempt at a non-fiction novel than a piece of historical biography. If you were to condense it around the actual history he's talking about, it'd be like 125 pages long.   \n",

The Sun Priests can no longer call the rains, and the town is facing water riots and a breakdown of all order.Yet in every corner and level of society, there are women who discover that THEY can do magic.  There isn't even a word for it: a woman-who-works-magic, but they are doing it.  Slowly, people are starting to believe.  Can they save the Yellow City?That's probably a terrible synopsis; I've left out all the interesting characters and social dynamics in this book!  I would say it's somewhat of a study in power as it shifts, and how people of good and poor character handle it.  Fortunately, some of those in a position to get or stay in power are those of good character, so we can root for them!I truly came to care for the main characters, and I hope to see more from them. There was a resolution of the problem, but I'd like to see more of what happenes to the society as the Sisters of the Raven become more accepted.I recommend this book to Hambly fans and others who want a contemplation of social and gender politics in a \"magical\" setting.   \n",

That said, I didn't expect this book to be a good read. Most of the freebies that are available aren't all that great. I liked this author so much, I got the rest of her Heat stories, and liked them all. This is a Sci-Fi Erotica story, it doesn't say when or where it is set. But it feels like an alternate universe in the future. It is between Aidan and War, our two main characters, Aidan is a pilot and War is called an Enforcer (basically a hired goon). The story kept me captivated, it had a believable romance between the two main characters, unlike other Erotic novels, they didn't go at it from page one. The Steamy scenes didn't come about until around Chapter Five. Her Heat series aren't the longest books, to me at least, but they did have substance, it was a full story with bits of erotica thrown in the appropriate parts, it kept me interested and captivated until the end.   \n",

Not only the author has great perspective on his own illness struggles, but his personal experience does not over-dominate the volume.  He did his homework, seamlessly mixing personal stories and interviews with people he met from all walks of life with more global depression facts.  Chapters on treatment alternatives and politics are superb, as well as an excellent chapter on the history of depression and how it has manifested itself through the ages.  I did find some sections a bit of a downer emotionally (I think unavoidable for some readers, given the subject matter), and it took a while for me to read it for that reason, but it was well worth it.  Small quibble - could have ended on a bit of a higher note.   \n",

Are they aliens or a form of creature from the depths of the sea which is now evolving.I really wanted to like this book but never getting any bigger picture of the disaster or even some sort of explanation really did leave me cold.The characters are an interesting bunch and Morris actually writes them intelligently and quite believably. The addition of a disabled character posed some unique problems for the survivors which I enjoyed.Maybe if Morris writes a sequel with some answers I may find myself appreciating this book more but as it stands at the moment I ultimately found myself cheated that the author did not give any form of conclusion but left you hanging.   \n",

There is a lot of good information on behaviorism buried in the recommendations...but sometimes you have to read about a completely unrelated training issue to find out about things like desensitization and counter-conditioning. If you have the time, definitely read entries on more than just the issue that interests you.There is also a bit more jargon in here than I thought was strictly necessary - if you don't have the concepts of behaviorism and learning theory down, you probably need to read another book before this one. Try such gems as Sophia Yin's \"How to Behave So Your Dog Behaves,\" which introduces the concepts *first,* then shows you how to apply them. Also check out anything by Patricia McConnell, who not only knows her stuff, but knows how to teach it.   \n",

is Intriguing and the subject matter is a fascinating history from a time of great social and political change in England and Scotland.   \n",

I first had a chance to read this work by Stephen Covey -fresh out of College, with a 2-year relationship and a relationship with my parents that was not precisely in great shape...Today, it's been  five years since I first read it,  and I can say without doubt that it has  changed deeply the way I see many things in life: the way I respond to  life's situations, the way I make my choices, the way I treat people... in  short, the way I live.The genius of Covey is that he was able to gather  in one piece a history of knowledge on how to behave in life, in order to  be a healthy, successful, right-doing, happy person.Most likely, it'll  take time to read and assimilate (not recommended if you want a quick-fix  for your problems).   \n",

I didn't even read the back of the book before I bought it. She is such a good writer and her love scenes are hot,hot,hot! This story was a bit different in that the heroine isn't all that likable in the beginning and a bit evil/ruthless. That was kind of hard to swallow at first. She grows on you though as you read it. I usually like my men to be the evil ones and the women to reform them but this was reversed. I probably would have given it 5 stars if it had been the other way around. If you haven't read any of Kresley Cole's books you have to start because they are fantastic.   \n",

It's a pretty entertaining series and I can see where Collins's work has had a particularly large influence on the dystopian genre as a whole. You can argue that there's better out there or more well known works, but this was exactly what such an under-noticed genre needed to fully push itself into mainstream notice, just as Twilight was what YA PNR/UF needed to gain traction.The basic premise here is actually pretty horrific for a teen/children's novel. You have a society that is constantly kept on the brink of starvation due to the seemingly selfish actions of an Orwellian government that is always watching for signs of rebellion. Despite there having been a potential mass extinction event, the world outside of the Districts is relatively full of life sustaining wild foods and game- which suggests that starvation could potentially be avoided if not for the Capitol's mandate that nobody stray outside of the walls. There was a rebellion, but it was squashed and in retaliation the Capitol essentially requires that every District send two children to the Hunger Games to fight each other semi-gladiator style for their amusement. The wealthier districts, the ones who can afford to train their children from birth and always seem to have enough to eat, don't mind this as much as the poorer districts who live day to day and enter the games emaciated- ensuring their defeat and deaths.It's into this type of world that we see Katniss, a girl who can't afford to be sentimental but is devoted to her family. She enters the games due to her love for her sister and ends up getting caught up in the various games the Capitol has to offer both in and out of the arena. Katniss is forced to agree to a rather twisted ploy for survival: to fake love with Peeta to gain support from various benefactors. This is actually fairly interesting, as many novels of this like would have her instantly falling for Peeta at first sight and there being obvious protestations of love from the get go. This might be spoilerish, but as there's tons of reviews of the book and movie commenting on their relationship I think that most will already be aware of the basic spoilers. Katniss takes a lot of convincing to even acknowledge what basic emotions she does feel, which I liked. The story in this first book isn't really about romance, it's about survival and personal freedoms first and foremost. It's obvious that romance will eventually become a main thrust of the series, but right here and now it's just having the groundwork laid for future love triangles and developments. I respect this, as most times you have the romance between the various characters be the central focus of the series, with anything else being there just to highlight how in \"wub\" the two main characters are. It's nice to have something that has the romance as something to accent a more major and more pressing plot point.This book isn't entirely perfect, mind you. There are points where the plot does seem to be a little overly extended and some readers will undoubtedly be frustrated with a general lack of detail about a lot of elements in the novel. As the book's focus is survival, we're given only what is most pertinent to the moment as far as back story goes for Panem in general. It makes sense that there wouldn't be gobs of info drops, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating at times. Having a little more description about how rough life is would make it more understanding to have someone around Katniss's age or the wonderfully tragic Rue's age act so mature. Their maturity is sometimes at odds with how they act, which both helps and hurts things. It reminds us that they're still kids but it'd also be good to show that these characters never had time to be kids.Ultimately though, this is a great book and the narration here is very well done. If you have a chance to listen to this as opposed to reading it, I highly recommend it. McCormick is pretty talented and I loved how she voiced Haymitch.   \n",

                                                 Because there are so many authors i have had the priviledge to read, i thought that Miss Ashley would bring it with this series installment. I only feel this way because all of her earlier novel were off the chain. Please don't make us wait so long if the book is going to be that short.   \n",

It's written as mostly anecdotes. The author also give some personal accounts about how this innovation bled into his training and practice as a physician.Unlike other readers, I didn't take the &#34;exploration&#34; title literally.  I think the exploration in the title is more scientific exploration of the limits of the human body.  That being said, one of the most interesting chapters was &#34;Ice,&#34; which did feature actual exploration.I thought the chapters on space were a bit thin and I, personally, could have done without them.   \n",

The premise and the potential for a great story is presented in the description, and it was a book that I jumped at the offer to review.  While I have not read the first, Blindfolded Innocence, I didn&#8217;t find that I was greatly hampered with not having the information from that book, and I went and grabbed it for my own library just to continue the ride in my &#8216;free&#8217; time.Brad and Julia are an interesting couple: their dynamic is still growing, as they are learning to deal with the emotional connection between them, and what that may mean.  Julia is a lighthearted and fun character, while she doesn&#8217;t seem to allow the emotional or sexual constraints to weigh her down, she is clearly carefully processing and integrating these changes, not nearly as carefree as one might expect.  There are moments where her immaturity grates, and I wondered about her appeal to someone more mature, but there was growth for her in this story, and I started to see Brad&#8217;s whys.Brad is far more serious, perhaps even a tad too much in his own head. As he reveals the secrets that have helped to shape his demeanor and reserve, the reasons do start to come clear, and it is more than obvious to everyone that Julia is just what he needs to take the edge off.A true study in the dynamics of love and trust: Julia displays so much confidence in Brad, her willingness to try first before dismissing outright scenes and situations that are unknown or even scary.  The balance between Dominant and submissive, and the effort expended by Brad to try and keep pushing Julia&#8217;s boundaries was detailed with grace and style: Julia&#8217;s willingness to trust in him, and give him the power to expose her to new and often scary situations show the clear need for a solid understanding and baseline of trust between any couple in the scene.While some may see Brad&#8217;s introduction of others into their relationship as a selfish and perhaps misogynistic act, it really serves to underline the careful study he has made of her, finding new experiences that he believes that she will enjoy, even as she had not contemplated those herself.  And steamy, squirmy hot does not even come close to describing the lushly detailed, sensually presented scenes that display their passion.Secondary characters and plotting elements add to the story, Martha is wonderful and shows a different side of Brad and his life and what he needs with her take no prisoners style and approach.  Add to that the murder and danger to Julia, and the twists provided there and the story becomes one that is hard to put down.Overall I really enjoyed this story and didn&#8217;t find a great lack of information in not reading the first of the series.  Moments of frustration with Julia&#8217;s immaturity were offset by the solid writing and clever details that kept me wondering what would happen next.  And the revelations about Brad&#8217;s secrets were wholly unexpected, just when I thought I knew what they would be, something entirely different popped out and left me cheering the author with a well done.  This is a book and series that you will want to dive into, and not come out until it is complete: and yet there is more to come, as there are still questions to be answered.I received an eBook copy from Media Muscle for purpose of honest review.

Instead of developing an actual plot line this book basically just followed an extremely awkward (but in no way redeeming) freshman in her first year of college at Harvard.  I kept reading expecting an interesting (or at least existent) plot to develop.  But no luck.  Besides the lack of plot, I had issues with the basic writing.  The dialogue was extremely unbelievable (has the author ever heard of a contraction?) and there wasn't one likable character.  I'm really not sure how the book was even published in the first place.  I think the author might have had a good basic idea at first, but then just lost all momentum once the writing got going.   \n",

I started reading Brooks when Sword of Shannara was his only book. As an Illinois lawyer (like Brooks) of similar age, and longtime fan of Tolkien, CS Lewis, Charles Williams (and, yes, Harry Potter) I have kind of identified with Terry Brooks, and have read all the Shannara books, as well as Word/Void. Though I doubt Brooks's Word/Void series began with a conscious plan to integrate them into the beginnings of the Shannara world, I thought it was really ideal when that effort began. It became apparent in Shannara, as you went along, that its world had evolved from a post-modern apocalypse of some kind, which works well and provides a lot of food for more novels. (I've read Canticle for Liebowitz, Malevil, On the Beach, and a bunch others of that genre as well, and Shannara'a evolution from that world just began to make great sense.) So, I had huge hopes with Genesis that Brooks would link up the world of Word/Void with Shannara. I thought Bearers, and Measure, would finish what Genesis had started in doing that.  But, I thought the resolution was left incomplete. Where was this valley? There was no map included, and I could not situate its only Shannara situs, Arborlon, or exactly where in the valley Arborlon was. I was expecting an ending where Panterra and Prue would vanquish the Ragpicker demon (a masterful villain, written about brilliantly) and go off to found Paranor, and Phryne would marry Pan, abdicate, and join him there, elfstones in tow. But, alas, no Paranor, and no anything else from Shannara except for the unlocatable Arborlon. Measure had me really enthused with the love/sexual relationship (first ever for a Brooks book, I think) between Pan and Phryne. But, then she abruptly leaves him, even doubts her having loved him, and dies, leaving that unresolved, too (though her tragic flaw of impetuousness is somewhat redeemed by her heroism in saving the elves from the trolls.) But how can Phryne be queen, which I thought was going to happen, being dead? Why not at least leave her fate unknown, something for Pan (and the rest of us) to hope for. If a heroine should have died, dare I say let it have been Prue, as the ultimate sacrifice in protecting the life of the comrade whom she deeply (though maybe not yet romantically) loved? But, wasn't Sider enough? It was almost like Game of Thrones, where so many of the sympathetic characters I liked are killed off and taken away from us. Well, the lack of a resolution caused me to drop a star from the rating. Still, Measure did add some, if not enough, substance to the Word/Void - Shannara link, and did at least resolve the undead demon that stalked through from Word/Void, and Genesis, to finally, and thankfully be destroyed in this latest volume. Indeed, Measure has a lot of exciting parts, and I believe it truly merits at least 4 stars. How to fix it from here? Maybe don't leap centuries into the future in your next book, past the latest Shannara era, but bring the Hawk's valley into the Duln forests, or Leah, or somewhere in Shannara, and give us the rest of the transition, the dwarves and the gnomes, and the Southlanders, and Paranor, and link Arborlon to where it is supposed to be. Maybe you can do it through Elven diaries and histories that are somehow discovered preserved and un-decomposed. But, why not instead just add a third book to the Bearer - Measure series? Make the demon either survive in spirit to corrupt some of the Glensk Wood or other folks so that they mutate into the evil beings that Brooks created in Shannara? Lots of possibilities there. Nonetheless, Measure was still good, and deserves to be bought and will provide enjoyment when read if you are any kind of fan of Terry Brooks, and I do recommend it.   \n",

Much of the claims in this book are based on fact.  Some based on circumstantial evidence.  The circumstantial evidence is very convincing.  The bottom line ....  If I was on the jury presented with information in this book, JK would be prosecuted for treason, falsifying government documents and lending aid & comfort to the enemy, just to name a few,.  And the verdict ...  GUILTY on all counts.   \n",

As a very amateur almost beginner home cook I find it slightly intimidating though no fault of the authors. The recipes look fantastic but I'm probably quite far from executing some of them while others look possible. I have thumbed through the mother ship \"Modernist\" set and found it interesting but never bought it. I think this will suit me better. I have been building up a library of books on classical techniques from Escoffier, Pepin, and Child zooming like a Kubrickian time portal to today with this book. So it's exciting to add this to the collection. I will certainly buy a pressure cooker and learn to use it and whip dispenser. I'm not so sure on Sous Vide, something about submerging meat in water just creeps me out even though it's in a bag. There is a lot of useful information on equipment use and maximizing flavor yield that I think I could use now. I consider this a reasonably priced book considering the quality of the information, research and the book itself.   \n",

But once we find out her mother's secret, nothing happens. Aimee Bender just keeps repeating the same things she already told us. It should have been a short story not a long one and I would have given it a better rating.Although, the piece of cake on the cover is quite beautiful and lovely, but even that couldn't make this book worth more than one star.   \n",

There is actually a better translation out there by Michael Saso (which is still somewhat confusing since that's the way it was originally written).  That translation is entitled The Gold Pavilion.It's nice that this work includes the Chinese characters (the Gold Pavilion does not)...however, only one English translated word was used for each Chinese character, when actually there could be a multitude of subtle meanings.  So I think in this version, the meaning is almost completely lost.  Besides the translation itself, it seems that the authors have a hard time communicating clearly in English at all...you can see this for yourself by reading the free preview.  It takes a lot of work on behalf of the reader.However, for the diehard Taoism scholar, maybe this book contains some hidden gems.   \n",

Like all Brookner's novels, the hero/ine is solitary, well off, and given to melancholy mental soliloquies. As always, the protagonist's choice of company is unsatisfactory, the few elderly people who have sparsely peopled his past and who are egotistical, selfish and argumentative, or a 50-ish woman who loudly presents claims and demands, amply self justified, of course. So the alternatives are unfulfilling company and the demands that company makes, or isolation and solitary cogitation, indeed fear of dying alone. Brookner skillfully juxtaposes pages of inner thoughts and anxieties, long spun-out indecision, with rapid fire confrontational dialogue as the protagonist tries ineffectively to placate acquaintances who reject his politeness and counter with forthright rudeness and renewed demands. This is a longtime Brookner theme: the quiet, peaceable and well-behaved are at the mercy of charming, gregarious users, out to exploit the quiet householder, turn him out of his or her house in the guise of a short term arrangement, and extract financial advantage from the protagonist's innocent friendship. Though every novel is a variation on this theme, there is no sense of repetition. Miss Brookner's novels are each distinct, each a quiet universe of feeling, with naifs and monsters vying unequally in an indifferent London. Always there is London, bleak, chill, raining, even springtime a disappointment. The protagonist's London is always contrasted with Paris or southern France where he seeks the warm deliverance of the sun. Somehow I never find these novels depressing. Miss Brookner is master of her constricted landscape, but her bleak worldview is not for everyone.   \n",

Even past 40, I find it enjoyable. As you flip through the pages, you get the sense that you really are seeing the science of everything. The articles are short, but clear, driving home the aspect of science or of how the world works that feeds into the wonder you are looking at, be it the biology of different animals or the functioning of electronic gadgets. The book is written about three notches below Wikipedia and two notches beneath How Things Work. That makes it perfect if you're looking for understanding without getting into supplemental reading or do it yourself projects to further investigate.I'll add that I found the introduction a bit self-congratulatory and off-putting, particularly with its ode to the wonders of science posed half as rebuke to those who don't agree with scientists (not the same as science) on all matters. It was unnecessary, as the book itself conveys the wonder of the world we live in perfectly well. I offer this mainly because if you are a parent who does not accept evolution, global warming or, for that matter, the utility of GMOs, I hope you won't look at the introduction and write off a very good book for curious young minds in all other regards.   \n",

There is no meat to this storyline.  the Setup was that out of the 3 brothers this one was dangerous?  No way.  There was no passion, there was drivel.  When the hero and heroine were locked up in the mountain stronghold, I thought there was more passion between the heroine and the guy that was across the hall in the dungeon.  He turned out to be a traitor but I liked him a whole lot better than the hero.  His character was more dark and dangerous not the hero of the book.   \n",

I listened in my car and enjoyed it very much.  (We envy so many people before we know what is actually going on in their lives... Wynonna has been through so much.  I hope it will be smooth sailing for her from here on out.  I sure would never want to trade places with her).  I enjoyed this book on CD and I learned a LOT from it as well.  However it does get a tad slow in places so be prepared.   \n",

She gets dolled up (not too slutty, not too nice) and goes to the local cop bar to pick up a cop. She lucks out when she spies Rogan at the bar nursing a beer after being stood up by a buddy. Mia takes a leap (metaphorically speaking) and, after asking if he's available (no wife or girlfriend), takes the plunge and tells him a bit about her fantasy. Things get hot from there.This is one of the shortest short stories I think I've read. I call it a mini story since it's only about 18 pages long. However, don't let the lack of length put you off. Like penis size, length has very little to do with enjoyment when it's wielded with expertise and there is a lot of punch in such a short space of text. Well-written and hot, I was right there with the characters. So much so that I felt like a voyeur. *fans self*An opening was left at the end for a second installment and I'm very much looking forward to reading it.*The author provided a copy of this story to me for review.

I loved possessive and alpha male Josh. However, there was just too many pages of boring filler.   \n",

He isn't a great writer, he doesn't challenge your preconceptions, he doesn't force you to think deeply, but he is still a good writer.  He knows how to put together an interesting story, how to write characters that you can believe, how to manage plot (even if he uses the same pacing and elements every time, but so what, it works).But this novel clearly shows that he should have taken a year off.  I don't want to go so far as to compare him to Jordan when he was publishing dreck for money in the middle of his WoT series, but this comes very close to that travesty.  The publisher doesn't care because the books sell anyway, even to disappointed fans, because we know that the author has the potential to deliver an excellent novel.This book is so mediocre that the next novel will be a tipping point for me with regard to this author.  If he doesn't get back in the game, if he phones in another installment, then I will have to part ways with this series.  I really don't want that to happen.   \n",

Last I checked, you can't prove a negative...  so perhaps someday we can explain what other scientists say is impossible.  Because today, there are simply too many topics in science that we can't explain (and our best guesses are pretty poorly defined)...  This book delves into what hasn't been explained, but unfortunately, the desire to know the answers of the authors questions is a bit frustrating, because nobody knows (yet.)   \n",

I'd call it more fantasy with a light romance thread. It was an engaging story, told from the point of view of Brock, our elf hero. He's been tainted by a vampyre and must find his and his people's salvation from the curse in a witch. Brock's quest takes him all over the known world until he chances upon the woman he seeks. But his quest is thwarted by blood thirsty monks and horrid creatures.Andrea Cooper's world building is vivid and carries a hint of the Lord of the Rings to it. The romance is not as strong as most romance readers would like, but I'm not like most romance readers as I enjoy books either way.The Garnet Dagger left off with the possibility of a sequel and it'll be interesting to see where Brock and his witch have gone.I was given an ARC in exchange for a fair review.   \n",

The outcome was clear from the beginning, regardless of the evidence, or lack thereof.  The author seems to have a hard time with the English language, although he appears to be English.  I found the book hard to read and even harder to comprehend.   \n",

She's beautiful not sturdy and arrives with a mountain of luggage and fancy clothes plus a small dog named Choo-choo. Carrie falls in love with Joshua's two children but he can't believe she can be a good mother or a  good wife to him.  When he leaves her alone to think things over she proves to be a very smart woman who has the ability to make money, lots of it. When he returns and wants her back, she takes her time and with the arrival of her perfect brother Ring things get sticky.  Joshua has a lot to think about. Maybe he was too quick to judge his beautiful wife after all.   \n",

Keep it simple.  Costs more than you can realize in a return.   \n",

Does that sound strange? Often popular authors disappear, as they should. King at his best rises above the &quot;popular  author&quot; tag.The Green Mile suffers a bit from King's having to  include detail in one segment to remind readers of something in an earlier  segment. I hope someday King will do a rewrite to smooth out the  transitions.But he has seldom written better, and I was enormously  surprised. Yes, he can be uselessly crude, and he is here. But his  characters walk and talk and think and fear, here as almost always.I  have been disappointed in much of King in the past several years; most of  his writer-centered stuff just doesn't seem to work.The Green Mile works  on a number of levels, artistic, intellectual, and emotional. It's not his  best work, but it's very close.   \n",

Its focus was more on Bella and her friendship with Jacob who has his own set of issues to deal with.What I didn't care for with New Moon was the fact that they downplayed the suicide attempt. Teen suicide is a very serious topic and it was glossed over like it didn't matter.  I also didn't care for the lack of caring for existence Bella and Edward had.I think Bella was shown to be needy and a little mentally unstable in certain parts of this book.  I was a little disappointed with the turn of her life in this book.The story dragged in some areas and it was a little redundant in certain parts of the book.  But the overall book was well written and edited.  I enjoyed the book even though I did have  few issues with subject matter.I found the additional characters introduced in this book a welcome pleasure and I can't wait to read more about them in future books. Once again the character development was really good.  Bella's unusual strength against Vampires is something I am really looking to learning more about and that was delved into more in this book.The book was really good and I definitely think people of all ages should give it a chance and read it.  But make sure you read the first book Twilight first or you could get a little lost in the back story.   \n",

But if for one person's whim can be a blackout and keep Vegas without water, I think that the State of Nevada has a very BIG problem as well as the whole country. If one simple woman thinks that she can do whatever she wants to Las Vegas's mob and get away with it... as it happened in the book... I think I better read Cinderella. It's more plausible.   \n",

I am ashamed to admit that I had no idea that Egypt was so oppressive!I read this book to learn about Egyptian culture and to sample their experience in America.  This book did that for me, so I learned a lot.  If that is your reason for reading it as well, you will be very satisfied. If you want merely entertainment, look elsewhere.  This book is more than that.Keep in mind that the author is a dentist in Cairo, Egypt who studied dentistry in Chicago.  He continues to be a dentist to keep up with society.  I feel like Alaa Al Aswany is capable of shedding light on Egyptian culture and criticism of his Egyptian characters is unwarranted unless you too are from the Middle East.It is more of a set of short stories than I expected.  I found the Arab names hard to remember.  For the first half of the book I had to look back and recall which character belonged to which name.  Alaa Al Aswany develops the characters fully (about 1/2 of the book is devoted to character development) before moving more into their stories.I found the book easy to read if you consider sentence structure and vocabulary.  It was hard to read the first 1/2 only because you to do not get attached to the characters for a until the latter half.  I found it laborious to read but I am thankful I stuck it out.  I felt like I knew the characters intimately when their stories did progress.(I am going to leave out spoilers)There was an Egyptian with an American wife and daughter.  His daughter gets involved with immoral activity.  You get to watch his reaction as he deals with things especially shocking for an Egyptian male.There is a dating couple considering marriage but tempted into making love.  They struggle to do what is acceptable to her parents back in Egypt.The President of Egypt visits Chicago and some characters create plans to promote democracy during his visit.There is a Christian Egyptian who struggles with accusations of abandoning his homeland.There is a couple in which the husband is looking to be promoted within the Egyptian government.The end came with several shocks/surprises that I did not see coming.   \n",

In short, Kagan is nostalgic for a circumstance dependent on unnatural conditions (unless, of course, he has decided that War is *healthy*, part of the natural order of things ..).  His call for the U.S. to assume global leadership is all well and good, but it tends to assume strange forms, such as attacking secular leaders in the Islamic world: Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi, President Assad.  One of Kagan's ideological soul-mates, Michael Ledeen, has openly declared that it's not in America's interest to have stability in that part of the world, that instability should be sown whenever possible.  I disagree with that assessment .. and using Kagan's formula - which includes supporting Saudi ideological imperialism - the end result is the rest of the world rooting for the downfall of the United States (a nation-state currently propped up by the military and its dominance of global financial institutions).  The U.S. can either become part of the emerging global economy or risk becoming irrelevant (see also \"the Portuguese Empire\").   \n",

No waiting for coals or wood to get hot, no ashes to dump...This Weber book isn't an all encompassing book like some of the other Weber books.  At just over 200 pages it's rather slight actually.  It gives just over a 100 recipes, more or less a sampling of what you can do on your gas grill rather than a bible type tome.  Tips are provided with colorful illustrations demonstrating direct and indirect cooking methods, as well as options for smoking and adding a rotisserie.  From there you get into the meat of the book (pun intended) and some very nice recipes.  Honestly a lot the recipes don't seem like \"guy\" type dishes.  I mean I can't see the average backyard cook making Prosciutto wrapped Shrimp for example.  It may be quite good but it's not my cup of tea.  I'd prefer some more stick to your rips type of recipes.  I did find a few so far that I did like...The Mediterranean Flank Steak is good.  I prefer it on a crusty italian roll rather than a pita, though.  The filet mignon with shoestring potatoes was great.  Filet Mignons are some of my favorite things to make on my grill.All in all, this book provides some interested deviations from typical grill fare so if that's what your're looking for this is a great book for you.   \n",

Anne Rice uses this historical period to write a compelling story of one family whose lives are played out against this unique societal tapestry.While today with our contemporary views we may find this societal tapestry difficult to understand, it is certainly worth reading about for the insights into the peculiar situation for free mulatto and quadroon women in New Orleans before the Civil War.  And while we may not be able to agree with some of the actions of the main characters, I felt those actions were believable in light of this story.I watched the DVD of the film version later, and while interesting, it lacks the insights that the book has.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller   \n",

What more could you ask for? A couple of days after reading it, I had to go back and re-read bits of it, just to make sure I understood what was going on. There are a lot of wait-a-minute moments, where everything you've assumed up to that point gets yanked out from under you. A word of warning, though: If you like stories with a nice, neat, happily-ever-after ending, you'll probably have a problem with this book.   \n",

You fall for the bad guy, our hero but alas the substance of the text is lacking some what. Such a shame this relationship had promise.   \n",

It's got a decent idea, and might be fun. But the constant spelling mistakes, and use of distracting phrases kills the writing flow.In addition:Characters appear and make grandiose statements, then disappear with \"other important things to attend to\".The main schoolyard drama between the main character and his antagonists develops over 3 encounters from \"I just met you and you're annoying\" to \"I'm now going to destroy you\". 3 encounters does not constitute plot development.Whenever a supporting character tells your main character he's \"almost like a god\", you may be...no, you ARE going a bit overboard as an author.After reading the entire book (expecting it to somehow get better) I'm still not sure what the rules for magic are, or how \"Vorms\" work at all.Seems like a first effort; needs cleaning up.   \n",

EJ is a damaged woman, damaged by her mother who was too busy with her career and herself to be A mother.  Jess is a self-proclaimed angel who decides that EJ needs her specialized angel-type help.  She kidnaps EJ and takes her back to Washington for the eighth wedding of EJ's mother, and then the sparks fly!  I did not give this book 5 stars because 1) the slow start, and more importantly 2) the inserts of Lilly's (EJ's mother) writing which, although I got used to it and found it mildly interesting, was totally superfluous to the story.  Most of these ebooks could use some good editing.   \n",

Still, in no way was my lack of experience with the author a bar to my enjoyment of The Death of Santini: The Story of a Father and His Son.I found this book to be very mature and very stimulating; as someone who has lost both parents, I found it very personally resonant in several key respects. However, there were some elements of Conroy's story I didn't find relatable personally, and to some extent that hindered my enjoyment of the book. It was also longer than I would have liked, but it's understandably hard to exclude things when one is dealing with such personal matters.I'd recommend this book to anyone who finds it productive to think about how our families make us who we are. I think you'll be touched by Pat Conroy's journey.Please be advised I got a free advance reader's copy through Goodreads Giveaways.   \n",

Once this military merchant tastes \"blood-money\" he rises like a seven headed vampire willing to suck the\" blood-money\" from the US Treasury. Vilify the enemy as terrorist and then kill them with impunity under the cover a spreading \"Democracy\".  We must remember Europe plundered Africa under the cover of spreading Christianity to the uncivilized natives - AMEN!Blackwater is also a look into the mind-set of the advocates for smaller non-intrusive government. However, those advocates only want government to outsource their work including military duties. Mercenaries are not new for US military; they come in different forms depending on the location. It is just mind boggling that right wing Christian ideology and American patriotism are fused by these groups with a mind-set to use military force to kill human beings, as if they got a mandate to help their god and country. This is the same ideological paradigm as any right wing god helping sect.Blackwater has placed a face on those  Christian right wing fear-mongers, and their sources of funding and methods and strategies used to support right winged politics and benefit from government contracts. These money grubbing \"god-helpers\" are skewed in one direction and have little real godliness.   \n",

good book but just about the worst proofread one I've ever seen.

They are all coming of age. It is a summer of discovery for all of them which continues through the following decades that they remain in touch.It begins in the summer of 1974. Julie's father has just passed away, at the untimely age of 42. When she receives a scholarship to attend the camp, Spirit in the Woods, her mom decides it would be good for her to go. While there, she flourishes. When some teens get together in a camp tepee and decide to form a group that will continue to be best friends forever, into the future, she is flattered to be invited to attend; Ash and Goodman, (sister and brother), Jonah, Kathy, Ethan (an animation genius) and Julie, the newbie, round out the circle of six. When they call her Jules, she adopts the name ever after. She does comedy routines at camp and comes out of her shell. She and Ash remain best friends into adulthood and all of them remain friends, throughout the years, periodically getting together again. For the most part, they support each other and are positive influences in each other's lives.The story follows these characters from the summer of Nixon's resignation to the ten year anniversary of 9/11, when they are in their fifties. Each of their lives plays out in a different direction. They remain friends all through the ensuing years, some becoming more successful than others. Each finds their own way. Two of them marry, one is gay, one accuses another of rape, one marries someone outside the circle (Dan), and one runs off and assumes another identity in order to escape the errors of his ways. All of them are fully formed, and we live with them, their failures, successes, mistakes and conflicts as they age and face the exigencies of life.There is some crude language and also there are unnecessary sex scenes which add nothing to the story's development. From my perspective, relevant and important subjects, like intermarriage, motherhood, parental death, divorce, separation, the Aids epidemic, premarital sex, drug use, and even autism, are only casually referenced and not fully explored, while, at the same time, largely irrelevant, liberal political views run rampant, throughout the text, at every opportunity. Wealth and the evil it spawns, coupled with its alter ego, privation, a problem apparently caused by the rich, in the author's view, are mentioned as well. (The expression of the author's personal political views seems to be a very common theme running through the novels today. Authors seem to want to express their personal views and not so subtly plant references to them.)The story is sometimes repetitious as it is retold from different character's points of view as events play out.These are not perfect characters; they have flawed families and imperfect lives, with all of the sundry normal problems and not so normal ones in evidence. They have emotional trauma, mental and physical issues and even legal problems to deal with at various points of the narrative. All of the themes are knitted together in the end when the story comes full circle. There are villains and heroes.In the end, it is about life changes and changing needs as we age. It is about money and the lack of it, what money can buy and what money can destroy. It is about beauty and the lack of it. It is about the relevancy and irrelevancy of issues that sometimes seem so important at one stage of life and so trivial at another. Still, sometimes it takes almost a lifetime to work out the effects of some events in our lives, in order to move forward and live again. Life isn't fair and it isn't a fairy tale. It is not for sissies.Absent the political bias which flies off the pages expressing the author's dislike of conservative politics, it is a really \"interesting\" study of a group of teens as they grow and mature, learn how to make choices, some good and some bad, and come to realize that being \"interesting\" is in the eye of the beholder and its importance depends on circumstances and moments in time. There are many poignant moments, and moments of truth, witnessed by the reader for each of the characters. In the end, most of the characters are altruistic and soon discover that money does not always lift up the rich, but often corrupts them. It is a person's behavior, hopes and dreams that define them, not their money or position or their popularity and beauty.   \n",

I began reading it, thinking I was getting a Fox News type of promised \"fair and balanced\" discussion, but I finished my reading with the realization that I had been snookered by a very unfair and unbalanced set of arguments.Mr. Crescenzi has some good points and he presents our sovereign and personal debt problems in some creative and meaningful ways, using phrases such as  \"The biggest Ponzi Scheme in History\", \"Age Warfare\", \"How Fiscal Illusions and Public Unions Ballooned our Debts\",  \"The Hypnotic Power of Debt\", and \"The 30 Year American Consumption Binge\"!Unfortunately (at least for the concept of \"fair and balanced\"), he totally seems to have forgotten our profligate MILITARY spending problem,  wherein in the last decade we've spent trillions of dollars (not just hundreds of billions) on largely wasted military actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.In fact our absurd military spending (note that we spend more on our military than all other nations combined, spend), and our military lobbying, tax breaks, etc., represent the military establishment's own variation on the Ponzi Scheme concept (with future taxpayers having to pay the prior military bills).I can only guess as to why the author went after the elderly, the American \"debt weakness\", the public and private unions, etc., while he totally omitted any discussion of the far greater military spending sources of our debt load. Hopefully he will explain this to us, the readers, so that we may feel he was more \"fair and balanced\" than he appears in this book.   \n",

The author did a unremarkable job with the writing style of this story I couldn't have been more happy to read another one from her. This was not only just a love story it was about people finding their true happiness and over-coming all their demons inside. And on that journey falling in love which was a plus if you ask me, It all worked out in the end.***I received this story for free in exchange for an honest review, see more of my review @ [...]   \n",

From the very first appearance of Spidey's black costume during the Secret War (the first and best) to a genuine knock-down-drag-out battle involving Venom and Spider-Man, this collection has a good start. Keep in mind though, it's only a start.If you already own the collection \"Spiderman Versus Venom\", you don't really need this one. There are several crossover issues from both books. And Venom really doesn't play a strong part until about halfway through this collection. We do get a lot of backstory about how the symbiote costume started controlling Peter and how he ultimately rid himself of it before it joined with Eddie Brock. To me, though, Eddie Brock's Venom makes the whole thing worth it. This was before he became the tamer, good guy version of himself later in the comics. This was Eddie when all he wanted to do was eat Spider-Man's liver and such. He was a genuinely scary villain, and probably the best foe Spidey faced during the 90's.I have no doubt there will be a volume 2 of this coming out later because of the abrupt end we have. Don't get me wrong, the story is finished, but there was a lot more history between these two later on.Again, a great collection to get you the Venom backstory. Just remember you'll be flipping quite a few pages before he actually shows up.   \n",

I liked the three main characters, I wish the perspective had been shared though, Evan and Rai were a bit flat. The others in the story were great, I loved Denise and Stella. Also Liam and Shannon. The relationship developed nicely between the three of them, the sex was hot, but was a bit much. Not much goes on between them that we see other than sex, a trip to a boot sale, a game, and a couple of meals. I liked Rai's owl obsession, and Evan's patient acceptance of it. Josh was a sweet blushing addition to their relationship.The story rolled along just fine, then BAM! It ended. I'm not really sure what happened, it just ended. Nothing about Josh giving Evan and Rai his gifts, nothing more about the other characters, or the glass shop, it just abruptly ended.Still a good read, I'd buy another from Josephine!   \n",

It is filled with beautiful color pictures which is nice but the information is all extremely simple and not helpful at all.Disney is very expensive but certainly a worthwhile trip.  It is very necessary to do a lot of research before planning to get the most for your buck and from your trip.  I highly recommend THE UNOFFICIAL GUIDE TO WALT DISNEY WORLD and the PASSPRTER GUIDE for extensive research, guidance on everything needed to plan an amazing trip.For pictures of what you will see when there get this book.  For me it ruins the surprises and some of the memories I want to make on my own.Disney is truly magical and shop wisely for the necessary guide books.   \n",

According to the author's note at the end, there are more installments coming, and I can see him gaining quite the fan following.  I want to give a word of warning though: Old World begins as a fairly standard zombie narrative, but it takes a turn into pure horror that won't be for everyone.The story begins with the Lochlears, a family which has survived the viral zombification of nearly all of the population of England, and the first few chapters introduce us to them and how they are surviving post-zombie apocalypse. They are a nice family, but they've been reduced to survivalism and brutal killing at a moment's notice in order to survive. It's a really interesting premise - trying to be a family while having to give up one's humanity, and the smooth, clear prose makes it quick, interesting reading. This beginning section fits in with the same kind of world as The Walking Dead, and it all seems fairly normal for zombie lit. When the glimmer of other survivors appears, the family hit the road in hope, and that is when the novella takes a distinct turn into truly nasty horror. I didn't see It coming and was pretty shocked. It's not my cup of tea, but Oliver Kennedy controls the scenes well; I just didn't have the stomach for this level of gruesome. I'm not sure it was all necessary, either, but for this style of horror the writing is very strong, and I can see Kennedy is taking the ideas somewhere very interesting. I just might be too faint of heart to follow!   \n",

abrupt.  I loved the book though it was really a great story there where some grammar errors but not so many that it distract from the book.   \n",

Even when the plot is weak, Chet is always good for a laugh.  Fortunately for fans of the series, this is one of Quinn's better books.A movie is shooting on location in the Valley.  The mayor (prompted by the city's insurance company) hires Bernie to keep an eye on the star.  Thad Perry has a taste for drugs and a knack for getting into trouble.  If the three weeks of filming pass without incident, the town will attract more filmmakers -- or so the mayor believes -- and the city's insurer won't have to pay any claims. Yet once filming begins, trouble of an unexpected nature ensues:  murder.  In the end, three murders come to light (albeit considerably separated in time) and it's up to Bernie and Chet to determine how they are related. Bernie is in charge of deduction; Chet (as he frequently reminds the reader) brings other things to the table.The mystery is a good one, much better than the plot that drove theprevious novelin the series.  Still, the story exists largely as an excuse to give Chet something to talk about.  Chet is the narrator and, as you might expect of a dog, he has trouble staying focused.  Chet's thoughts tend to meander (often in the direction of his next meal) but they always end up in a happy place.  Chet might ponder a profound question for a few moments -- If Bernie has a word on the tip his tongue, why can't Chet see it? How can Bernie's bark be worse than his bite when Bernie doesn't bark? -- but Chet doesn't sweat the small stuff.  His running commentary on life (\"a fluffy white towel can be fun to drag around\") is hilarious.Like all dogs, Chet enjoys eating (ribs are a favorite), napping, and riding in cars.  He has some impulse control issues, particularly when cats are around, but the beauty of Quinn's writing lies in his illumination of the canine mind.  Bernie might think Chet is misbehaving, but Chet's behavior is perfectly natural ... to Chet.  Whether he's shredding the leather seats in Bernie's new Porsche or making an uninvited leap into someone's swimming pool, Chet's actions always make perfect sense ... to Chet.A Fistful of Collars moves at a steady pace and features enough action and detection to satisfy mystery and light thriller fans, but the story is clearly geared to dog lovers.  This is neither a hardcore thriller nor a complex mystery.  The writing is breezy, the language is clean, and humor (invariably generated by Chet's antics and commentary) is the animating force.  New readers can enjoy the story even if they haven't read the earlier installments, but series fans will appreciate the mild intrigue surrounding Bernie's changing relationship with his girlfriend.  Chet doesn't quite understand what that's all about, while readers will have to wait for the next book to learn how Bernie's romantic life will unfold.  Until then, Bernie at least has Chet at his side.If I could, I would give A Fistful of Collars 4 1/2 stars.   \n",

I was afraid that the rest of the characters would be as unrelatable, but fortunately those fears were unfounded. The premise of the novels -- the marriage of man and alternate reality technology -- was well thought out with all its implications. It simultaneously captures the wonder of what could be possible with such technology, and serves as a cautionary tale. That is a mark of excellent science fiction. I found myself liking the work more and more as I continued to read and now I am looking forward to future installments.   \n",

It was his first day at school and he wanted to set of  the fire alarm. But he was to scared bc he might get caught or something. But he had a crush on this girl. So she asked him to eat with her and the boy said ok. So they went to eat lunch and they had a good time together. After the boy was telling his friend Leo about what he did with the girl. So after he and his friend both had a good time. But I don't feel the rest of the story. . So if you read this, this is part of it.   \n",

interest long enough to finish it. The more I read the more I became involved with the characters. It reminded me of what's important in life.   \n",

Good indexing systems not only store page 'numbers' (specific sites) but also 'locations' within the pages. Thus, one can find a phrase query hit by only looking at a few lines in an index rather than reading through large numbers of web pages. This also easily allows NEAR queries (eg. w/i 5 words of each other), an important component for ranking.The 'rank' of a page turns on relevance, and where query words occur near each other they're more likely to be relevant. HTML uses 'metawords' indicating eg. 'title start,' 'title end' that allow search engines to further improve rankings via explicit consideration of titles.Hyperlinks are phrases on a web page that take one to another page when clicked on - usually highlighted in blue. The number of hyperlinks can be used for ranking, though they can't distinguish between good and bad references within the linked material. The number of pages linked to a particular sources provides a measure of authority. (MacCormick then refers to the 'random surfer' trick to handle circularity.) Unfortunately, people can abuse the hyperlink trick to artificially inflate the ranking of their own web pages by creating large numbers of web pages linking to them, but MacCormick doesn't explain how good search engines discount these. Google now uses over 200 signals in page ranking.Public Key cryptography with 128-bit encryption uses a 38-digit number as it key. In addition, long messages are broken up into small 'blocks' of fixed size, usually 10-15 characters, and each block is then transformed ten or more times per complex rules. The most popular block cipher now is AES.The Diffie-Hellman key exchange system sets up the key for stranger exchanges using prime numbers. Such a system is used whenever a site starts with 'https' instead of 'http.' MacCormick first uses a simplified example involving paint colors to introduce the concepts.Then its on to other subjects. Again, well-done, though not always easy reading.   \n",

It brought out my anxiety. Any mother would be anxious as she reads this!This is in the author's country, Canada. It isn't over emphasized but makes you want to go there. It sounds like it must be absolutely beautiful!This is about the kidnapping, torturing, dismembering and killing of children, which makes it a book I will never read again. I will forever have nightmares from this!The main character's son has a disability. He is unable to speak. Yes, you do find out why.Ghosts waft about and take over at times, be prepared. As usual, they need help.Yes, I read this with text-to-speech on my Kindle.I don't usually read mysteries, neither do I read books that will keep me awake or cause nightmares. The author leaves all the clues you need to solve the mystery. You do see it coming. Even still, as gruesome as this mystery is, you keep reading in hopes of closure for the poor mother who has been through enough.Strong fem. She just doesn't know it. She hides from her own strength in her alcohol. But when she is more sober, facing her demons, so-to-speak, you know that any person would want to escape this mess, any way they could.If I were into crime mysteries I think I would give this five stars. I prefer books like Cheryl Kaye Tardif's Whale Song.   \n",

She had an almost insatiable hunger for love combined with ridiculous taste in men. She had a short attention span. She was, as Brown points out again and again, \"a tactician,\" who often exhibited reckless disregard for the long-term consequences of her actions. All true.And yet, even after all this is disclosed, the woman we see is am ambitious, empathic woman, a mother who loves her sons, and a charismatic force of nature with a nearly undefeatable spirit. I don't know if it's Brown's writing or the power of Diana's personality that make her someone you root for, even as she races toward that sad end in Paris.My biggest quibble with the book is NOT ENOUGH PHOTOS. Over and over, Brown makes reference to this iconic photograph, or to that famous dress she wore, or how Diana's style changed to reflect her evolving personality ... and it would be nice if those photos were included in the book. I found this frustrating.   \n",

Sweet and adorable will most likely be the first two words to pop into any reader's head whenever their thoughts turn to Nichole Chase's latest YA novel. Meena lives in the Bahamas with her adopted parents, helping them run their animal shelter, Flukes. Since she's been home schooled her whole life, her biggest worries aren't bullies or boys, but the secret she's hiding. That dynamic changes the moment she meets Blake. Blake is assigned to work at Flukes because of an incident that leaves community service as his only option if he wants to receive his high school diploma. While Meena may believe that staying away from Blake will protect her secret, she learns that maybe her secret isn't in too much danger with him.Flukes flows at a very quick pace filling readers up with romance and mysticism. Blake and Meena ruled this story and every moment that Chase spends on their growing relationship is well spent. However, for readers who love the catch of suspense and strong hints of danger, Flukes doesn't have much of either. The limited amount of conflict in the plot gives the story a breezy feeling, as if anything bad that might happen will be very easy to overcome. Out of the whole novel there's just two or three scenes that provide real conflict in either Meena or Blake's lives and they're short-lived or too simple. The impact could have been much greater on the intensity of the plot, if Chase expounded when it came to relating the issues to readers.Meena's sweetness coupled with Blake's protectiveness takes the novel's romance to a warm, cherishing level. Chase's characters are strong and humorous, giving Flukes a lightness that will make readers sigh with contentment throughout the story.*ebook provided in exchange for an honest review*   \n",

I was looking forward to reading this, but came away in dismay. The author profiles each of the Bonds, and does offer up tidbits of production information. The interviews (most of which seem to be several years old) with each actor seem interesting enough- Timothy Dalton's commentary is most enlightening of those interview transcripts. Still, the vast majority of the book amounts to little more than detailed film summaries. Most Bond fans have either seen each of the films or know enough about them that they don't need summaries. In the end, the impression is that the reader feels disappointed.   \n",

The writing's fairly taut and fresh and the plot cracks along but the modern tone, though justified by the surprise plot twist at the end, seems remarkably out of place. We get a fairly good tour of the English (and Welsh) countryside as our reluctant viking protagonist learns to raid and kill in the best tradition of his forebears, gets lost from his raiding party and hooks up with a lovely, if mysterious, female companion and finally finds his shipmates again, only to get swept overboard, with the girl, and end up in the monastery at Lindisfarne just prior to the historical raid on that site which kicked off the full scale viking age in England -- which was to trouble the natives there for the next hundred years or so. We get an oddly bracing picture of these vikings too, professional warriors that they were, as they ready themselves for each upcoming encounter (not unlike the limbering-up exercises of a modern football team about to meet the \"other side\" out on the gridiron in a friendly match) -- you almost have to believe in the realism of it all, despite the warm fuzzy feeling you get once you've really gotten to know these boys. Even Thorfinn Skullsplitter seems like the kind of guy you wouldn't mind splitting a beer with -- assuming that's all he's in the mood for cleaving. But the dragon stuff seems rather forced and out of place. And the end, clever as it is, only adds to the sense that this book and this author didn't quite know where they wanted to go with the story. The protagonist's \"voice\" lapses into a rather sophomoric, counter-cultural patois as the tale winds down, which is both jarring and debilitating to the rest of the tale. And, though it's justified by the ending, the ending itself is discordant with what went before. You may guess it from the way the story moves, but I doubt you'll figure out the locale.The surprise ending in this one seems to have pleased many readers but I found it a bit off-putting, myself, turning what had seemed to me to be a good, and nicely paced, historical yarn into something a bit too self-concious and cute. I prefer my viking tales with a larger dash of authenticity so the abrupt plot twist which brings this one to a close, left me a bit cold.But it's nicely written and holds the reader to the end.SWM   \n",

I could have done without the constant ruminations by Cal about his hopeful love life and past which took up way too much space and detracted from the story. Enjoyed the short chapters.   \n",

It still holds up! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I could tell who would end up with whom early on, and it seems they jump in bed without really considering what they are doing...just &#34;scratch the itch&#34;.

in their life.It's a fast read and very thoughtprovoking.The only thing I did not like was the use of the New Century and Messenger Bibles.   \n",

I finally succumbed and bought Spider's Bite. Unfortunately, I was right. It wasn't for me.Strong characters, lots of action, impressive world building and some sexual tension - but I couldn't get past the level of violence.It's funny. GA Aiken's Dragon series is violent, but I adjusted to that. Perhaps because it's tempered with humour and love and family.Spider's Bite was just too strong for me. But if you're not freaked by a bit of blood and revenge, I can see why this series has its committed fans.   \n",

Besides, I want to make this spoiler-free.A few have mentioned the improvement in Butcher's writing, but I still have to chime in on that.  In his first books, he was a good but not great author - unsurprising given that they were his first published works.  What sets Butcher apart to me is that where many in contemporary publishing start to decline noticeably in the quality of their writing after gaining some success, he hasn't.  In point of fact, he's clearly been working to improve every aspect of his storytelling.Take any component of a good tale - characterization, character development, relationships, dialogue, plot structure and complexity, world-building, internal consistency, and just the craft of creating prose that leads a reader through a series of ideas, thoughts, events in order to build to a conclusion not just of plot but of an IDEA - Jim Butcher has now shown he is capable of doing all of these and doing them well.Without delving into spoilers, the last novel in the series,Changes: A Novel of the Dresden Files, contained Many Significant Events and also illuminated the significance of previous events in new ways.  By the end of the novel, the world the characters lived in had been utterly transformed.This novel was about many things, but the one that stands out above the rest is consequences, using the aftermath of the previous novel as the driving force behind the idea.  Obvious, perhaps, but Butcher comes at it from different directions, giving more depth to it than just a sort of \"A Christmas Carol\" or \"Its a wonderful life\" approach, I thought.I cannot recommend this book strongly enough.  Be warned however, that much of what is to be absorbed from it would be lost without reading the earlier works, preferably in order from book one,Storm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1).  There is a story arc to the Dresden Files and one would be doing oneself a real disservice to read them out of order.   \n",
              "117  For those who complain that McMurtry's STREETS OF LAREDO didn't have the same feel as LONESOME DOVE, it's a legitimate critique, but it's also one that misses the point.STREETS OF LAREDO is by far a more effective, chilling and worthy book than any of the prequels that McMurtry would later pen about Gus and Call's earlier days (all of them enjoyable reads...but none of them ever managed to recapture the magice of LONESOME DOVE).As far as I'm concerned STREETS OF LAREDO is one of the most terrifying books I've ever read. Some of the scenes of brutality and cruelty are tons more frightening and nightmarish than anything ever penned by Stephen King.LONESOME DOVE...though, no doubt, filled with a gritty realism that has often been lacking in Westerns (either on film or in literature)...did still convey some sense of romance to the Western. Even though LONESOME DOVE is in a leagure of its own, one can still see homage being paid to classics such as RED RIVER, THE GUNFIGHTER, THE COWBOYS and THE SEARCHERS both on page and on film.STREETS OF LAREDO strips away the romance and paints a picture of a dying era.The likes of Woodrow and his peers have become so scarce that it's gotten to the point where a hero such as Charles Goodnight will pause in the desert to have a conversation with a human monster such as John Wesley Hardin (a chilling scene in STREETS OF LAREDO that's akin to the Angel Gabriel and Lucifer meeting face to face).STREETS OF LAREDO is in the same league as the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone or more brutal Westerns such as Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH (and even shares a bit with the theme of the more low-key homage to the dying West that's depicted in THE SHOOTIST). If LONESOME DOVES had its share of heroes who seem bigger than life, STREETS OF LAREDO shares all the grotesque qualities of a Leone Western by filling its landscape with characters barely worthy of life. Disurbingly nightmarish places such as Crow Town in STREETS OF LAREDO would not be at all out of place in one of Leone's MAN WITH NO NAME(Clint Eastwood) TRILOGY.What's especially brilliant about STREETS OF LAREDO is that McMurtry builds up such a grand landscape with so many rich characters in LONESOME DOVE...only to tear apart that terrain, its heroes and its nobility with his sequel. It is a jarring book, for sure. Even though LONESOME DOVE is not without its disturbing & brutal moments, there is a nobility to many of the scenes and characters (which is why it's so well-loved...and will continue to be well-loved for many, many decades). Yet, to make sur that we're not too smitten or swept away by the grandeur of LONESOME DOVE, McMurtry delivered STREETS OF LAREDO as a way of showing us the dark underbelly of the beast that we didn't completely see in LONESOME DOVE. Without Gus riding by Woodrow's side, Captain Call has become every bit as much a shell of a man as Eastwood in the Leone movies (or in UNFORGIVEN). It is not easy to read...and perhaps McMurtry would have left many readers much more happy had he let the LONESOME DOVE saga end with that one book. However, by writing STREETS OF LAREDO McMurty provides the hangover that comes after a night of drunken revalry. It's not an easy read...it strips away the myth & awe that LONESOME DOVE provided to so many...but it is brilliant.With those two books (LONESOME DOVE and STREETS OF LARED0), McMurty managed to go from conjuring up the spirit of John Ford/Howard Hawks to evoking the demons of Leon/Peckinpah.In many ways one could draw a parallel to this pair of books to THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER PART II. Though both GODFATHER films are brutal, one shows the rise of a glorious America...while the other shows its fall (all through the character of Michael Corleone). McMurtry accomplishes the same with LONESOME DOVE (the more glorious time) and STREETS OF LAREDO (the fall of such glory).I mean, finding out within the first dozen pages or so that Newt was killed shortly after the story of LONESOME DOVE ends...that pretty much let the reader know from the word \"go\" that we'd be in for a dark ride with this book.If LONESOME DOVE...even amidst the betrayals, the murders, the senseless killings, the dirt and the grime...managed to speak to the better angels within us, the STREETS OF LAREDO speaks to our demons. With this in mind, I find these two books to complete and complement one another. STREETS OF LAREDO, by its very dark/dim nature, manages to exalt LONESOME DOVE even more.While LONESOME DOVE, through its sweeping majesty, manages to make STREETS OF LAREDO all the more disturbing.As for the other books with Gus & Call...they are entertaining at best... but none of the prequels ever come close to accomplishing the jarring dichotomy that McMurty accomplishes with his pairing of LONESOME DOVE and STREETS OF LAREDO.So, for those who are disappointed or disturbed by STREETS OF LAREDO...I'd suggest that you put a few CDs of Ennio Morricone's Western Themes on the stereo to play in the background while giving this book another reading. You might find that it's in the same league as LONESOME DOVE itself when read this way.   \n",

Although I would swear that when I first downloaded this \"book\" it was 25kb and it was just called \"On Gratitude.\"  Now it's called \"On Gratitude; Alicia Keys\" and it's listed at 15kb in size.If nothing else, it looks like Amazon heard the complaints and decided to make some changes to the title.   \n",

Seems like old plots from the previous Malory's were reused.  If this had been the first Malory novel I had read then it would have also been the last.  JL seems to be propping the last 2 Malory stories up with the more lovable Malory characters.  I think there would have been a better way to go with Jeremy's story; as with Derek's story, James and Tony seemed to be the hero's.  I would like to see a book for Drew Anderson but not if he can't stand on his own. I was so hoping Jeremy's story would come about from a bet with his cousin Amy.  Jeremy used to be a lovable rake; in this book he didn't seem like a rake at all. Kinda boring.  Wasn't really thrilled with Danny either.   \n",

There is a clearly defined mythology, religion, political system, philosophy and ecology in this world.  Despite all the introduced terminology in the book, I feel it is easy enough for the reader to pick up and understand these new terms.Having said that, I did not find the main characters, or many of the other characters, interesting.  Paul and Jessica are unappealing characters because of their seeming penchant for all of their actions to be based on political reasons.  While there is a need for it at times, it seems like all of their actions are made for manuvering their survival on Arrakis.  I feel that the better characters are Gurney Halleck and Dr. Yueh.  Both men have detailed backstories that fully explain their motivations in the actions they take, which are made for a myriad of reasons, not just political.I felt that the book would have benefitted from more of a balance between action and political intrigue.  The action sequences that did take place were ok, and would have kept my interest more.I realize that I am in the minority with my opinion of Dune.  I give Herbert a lot of credit for creating a fully imagined and detailed world, and this novel was no doubt groundbreaking at the time of publication.  For me, the book would have benefitted more if the same detail had been paid to his characterizations.   \n",

Ya know, wondering if the story would linger in my thoughts.  It did, which is why I gave it four stars instead of three.  But even though I'm giving it four stars, this book has an equal amount of pros and cons.  I'll start with the cons.1. Way too much internal dialogue--the babble dragged on and on.  Tru is constantly hashing over her blasted feelings, repeating the same thoughts throughout.  I would've enjoyed more actual dialogue between the characters or just edit it out all together.  I skipped countless paragraphs of insignificant mind chatter.2.  A bit juvenile at times with the love triangle scenes.  The bar scene with Will, Tru, and Jake is of a high school mindset.  I know Towle was trying not to depicted Tru as a callous harlot, but the way she lied to Will and her reasoning behind it was just ... well ... straight out of high school.3.  The name The Mighty Storm.  I kept thinking about the Christopher Guest mockumentary, A Mighty Wind.  Hilarious movie but I didn't want to associate it with a sexy rockstar romance.Pros:1.  Towle can write a solid love story and create an alluring lead man, or should I say, lead rockstar.  Jake was a hotty, and I fell hard for this sexy piece of guitar-playing-ass.  Although Tru, IMO, comes across as the two-timing tramp at times, I liked her too.  I was cheering the couple on from the get go.2.  Dialogue.  I wanted more of it!!  I loved the exchanges between Tru and Jake.  Their conversations made me blush, giggle with anticipation, shed a tear (from anger and joy), and feel strongly connected to both. This is why the book lingered in my thoughts--great exchanges between the pair.3.  The famous rockstar premise has a provocative draw--I enjoyed getting sucked into their world.  It was fun escapism!   \n",

Here we have a Lizzy and Darcy who are deeply in love from the beginning and the author creates obstacles and situations to which there was an obvious solution all along. All the text in between is just filler going around in circles.As a non-vampire fan who bought this on impulse, a lot still confuses me after the book ended and the author makes no attempt to explain or resolve the issue. For example, aren't people bound to notice that the Lizzy and Darcy aren't getting any older as the years pass? How are they planning to explain this? Even the supernatural realm has to be grounded in some sort of logic.Other reviewers have complained that the book was too short. I'm not adding my voice to theirs. I'm actually glad it didn't go on any longer. This was my first and last sojourn into the vampire camp. I'm glad I didn't spend more or have to read longer.   \n",

I really didn't like the first 2 books. I thought Barb was a total jellyfish who I wanted to punch in the face. Boohoo, your husband left. Get a spine . Be brave for your kids. Then, later in book 1, she got a bit better. Book 2 was still a lot of insecurities but she did better. Books 3 and 4 were much better. Better plot twists, characters had much more depth. Story line was much better.If you really didn't care for the first book, I would say to stick it out until the end.I don't think old Barb is an annoying wet noodle anymore. :)   \n",

I enjoyed it, but it wasn't like I wanted to stay up all night reading it. It really had no point to it other than get drunk and find love, but then get rid of it? I liked it and I hope I like the movie as well   \n",

It's an easy read, but it reads more like a poor attempt at a non-fiction novel than a piece of historical biography. If you were to condense it around the actual history he's talking about, it'd be like 125 pages long.   \n",

The Sun Priests can no longer call the rains, and the town is facing water riots and a breakdown of all order.Yet in every corner and level of society, there are women who discover that THEY can do magic.  There isn't even a word for it: a woman-who-works-magic, but they are doing it.  Slowly, people are starting to believe.  Can they save the Yellow City?That's probably a terrible synopsis; I've left out all the interesting characters and social dynamics in this book!  I would say it's somewhat of a study in power as it shifts, and how people of good and poor character handle it.  Fortunately, some of those in a position to get or stay in power are those of good character, so we can root for them!I truly came to care for the main characters, and I hope to see more from them. There was a resolution of the problem, but I'd like to see more of what happenes to the society as the Sisters of the Raven become more accepted.I recommend this book to Hambly fans and others who want a contemplation of social and gender politics in a \"magical\" setting.   \n",

That said, I didn't expect this book to be a good read. Most of the freebies that are available aren't all that great. I liked this author so much, I got the rest of her Heat stories, and liked them all. This is a Sci-Fi Erotica story, it doesn't say when or where it is set. But it feels like an alternate universe in the future. It is between Aidan and War, our two main characters, Aidan is a pilot and War is called an Enforcer (basically a hired goon). The story kept me captivated, it had a believable romance between the two main characters, unlike other Erotic novels, they didn't go at it from page one. The Steamy scenes didn't come about until around Chapter Five. Her Heat series aren't the longest books, to me at least, but they did have substance, it was a full story with bits of erotica thrown in the appropriate parts, it kept me interested and captivated until the end.   \n",

Not only the author has great perspective on his own illness struggles, but his personal experience does not over-dominate the volume.  He did his homework, seamlessly mixing personal stories and interviews with people he met from all walks of life with more global depression facts.  Chapters on treatment alternatives and politics are superb, as well as an excellent chapter on the history of depression and how it has manifested itself through the ages.  I did find some sections a bit of a downer emotionally (I think unavoidable for some readers, given the subject matter), and it took a while for me to read it for that reason, but it was well worth it.  Small quibble - could have ended on a bit of a higher note.   \n",

Are they aliens or a form of creature from the depths of the sea which is now evolving.I really wanted to like this book but never getting any bigger picture of the disaster or even some sort of explanation really did leave me cold.The characters are an interesting bunch and Morris actually writes them intelligently and quite believably. The addition of a disabled character posed some unique problems for the survivors which I enjoyed.Maybe if Morris writes a sequel with some answers I may find myself appreciating this book more but as it stands at the moment I ultimately found myself cheated that the author did not give any form of conclusion but left you hanging.   \n",

There is a lot of good information on behaviorism buried in the recommendations...but sometimes you have to read about a completely unrelated training issue to find out about things like desensitization and counter-conditioning. If you have the time, definitely read entries on more than just the issue that interests you.There is also a bit more jargon in here than I thought was strictly necessary - if you don't have the concepts of behaviorism and learning theory down, you probably need to read another book before this one. Try such gems as Sophia Yin's \"How to Behave So Your Dog Behaves,\" which introduces the concepts *first,* then shows you how to apply them. Also check out anything by Patricia McConnell, who not only knows her stuff, but knows how to teach it.   \n",

is Intriguing and the subject matter is a fascinating history from a time of great social and political change in England and Scotland.   \n",

when I first had a chance to read this work by Stephen Covey -fresh out of College, with a 2-year relationship and a relationship with my parents that was not precisely in great shape...Today, it's been  five years since I first read it,  and I can say without doubt that it has  changed deeply the way I see many things in life: the way I respond to  life's situations, the way I make my choices, the way I treat people... in  short, the way I live.The genius of Covey is that he was able to gather  in one piece a history of knowledge on how to behave in life, in order to  be a healthy, successful, right-doing, happy person.Most likely, it'll  take time to read and assimilate (not recommended if you want a quick-fix  for your problems).   \n",

I didn't even read the back of the book before I bought it. She is such a good writer and her love scenes are hot,hot,hot! This story was a bit different in that the heroine isn't all that likable in the beginning and a bit evil/ruthless. That was kind of hard to swallow at first. She grows on you though as you read it. I usually like my men to be the evil ones and the women to reform them but this was reversed. I probably would have given it 5 stars if it had been the other way around. If you haven't read any of Kresley Cole's books you have to start because they are fantastic.   \n",

It's a pretty entertaining series and I can see where Collins's work has had a particularly large influence on the dystopian genre as a whole. You can argue that there's better out there or more well known works, but this was exactly what such an under-noticed genre needed to fully push itself into mainstream notice, just as Twilight was what YA PNR/UF needed to gain traction.The basic premise here is actually pretty horrific for a teen/children's novel. You have a society that is constantly kept on the brink of starvation due to the seemingly selfish actions of an Orwellian government that is always watching for signs of rebellion. Despite there having been a potential mass extinction event, the world outside of the Districts is relatively full of life sustaining wild foods and game- which suggests that starvation could potentially be avoided if not for the Capitol's mandate that nobody stray outside of the walls. There was a rebellion, but it was squashed and in retaliation the Capitol essentially requires that every District send two children to the Hunger Games to fight each other semi-gladiator style for their amusement. The wealthier districts, the ones who can afford to train their children from birth and always seem to have enough to eat, don't mind this as much as the poorer districts who live day to day and enter the games emaciated- ensuring their defeat and deaths.It's into this type of world that we see Katniss, a girl who can't afford to be sentimental but is devoted to her family. She enters the games due to her love for her sister and ends up getting caught up in the various games the Capitol has to offer both in and out of the arena. Katniss is forced to agree to a rather twisted ploy for survival: to fake love with Peeta to gain support from various benefactors. This is actually fairly interesting, as many novels of this like would have her instantly falling for Peeta at first sight and there being obvious protestations of love from the get go. This might be spoilerish, but as there's tons of reviews of the book and movie commenting on their relationship I think that most will already be aware of the basic spoilers. Katniss takes a lot of convincing to even acknowledge what basic emotions she does feel, which I liked. The story in this first book isn't really about romance, it's about survival and personal freedoms first and foremost. It's obvious that romance will eventually become a main thrust of the series, but right here and now it's just having the groundwork laid for future love triangles and developments. I respect this, as most times you have the romance between the various characters be the central focus of the series, with anything else being there just to highlight how in \"wub\" the two main characters are. It's nice to have something that has the romance as something to accent a more major and more pressing plot point.This book isn't entirely perfect, mind you. There are points where the plot does seem to be a little overly extended and some readers will undoubtedly be frustrated with a general lack of detail about a lot of elements in the novel. As the book's focus is survival, we're given only what is most pertinent to the moment as far as back story goes for Panem in general. It makes sense that there wouldn't be gobs of info drops, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating at times. Having a little more description about how rough life is would make it more understanding to have someone around Katniss's age or the wonderfully tragic Rue's age act so mature. Their maturity is sometimes at odds with how they act, which both helps and hurts things. It reminds us that they're still kids but it'd also be good to show that these characters never had time to be kids.Ultimately though, this is a great book and the narration here is very well done. If you have a chance to listen to this as opposed to reading it, I highly recommend it. McCormick is pretty talented and I loved how she voiced Haymitch.   \n",

The premise and the potential for a great story is presented in the description, and it was a book that I jumped at the offer to review.  While I have not read the first, Blindfolded Innocence, I didn&amp;#8217;t find that I was greatly hampered with not having the information from that book, and I went and grabbed it for my own library just to continue the ride in my &amp;#8216;free&amp;#8217; time.Brad and Julia are an interesting couple: their dynamic is still growing, as they are learning to deal with the emotional connection between them, and what that may mean.  Julia is a lighthearted and fun character, while she doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to allow the emotional or sexual constraints to weigh her down, she is clearly carefully processing and integrating these changes, not nearly as carefree as one might expect.  There are moments where her immaturity grates, and I wondered about her appeal to someone more mature, but there was growth for her in this story, and I started to see Brad&amp;#8217;s whys.Brad is far more serious, perhaps even a tad too much in his own head. As he reveals the secrets that have helped to shape his demeanor and reserve, the reasons do start to come clear, and it is more than obvious to everyone that Julia is just what he needs to take the edge off.A true study in the dynamics of love and trust: Julia displays so much confidence in Brad, her willingness to try first before dismissing outright scenes and situations that are unknown or even scary.  The balance between Dominant and submissive, and the effort expended by Brad to try and keep pushing Julia&amp;#8217;s boundaries was detailed with grace and style: Julia&amp;#8217;s willingness to trust in him, and give him the power to expose her to new and often scary situations show the clear need for a solid understanding and baseline of trust between any couple in the scene.While some may see Brad&amp;#8217;s introduction of others into their relationship as a selfish and perhaps misogynistic act, it really serves to underline the careful study he has made of her, finding new experiences that he believes that she will enjoy, even as she had not contemplated those herself.  And steamy, squirmy hot does not even come close to describing the lushly detailed, sensually presented scenes that display their passion.Secondary characters and plotting elements add to the story, Martha is wonderful and shows a different side of Brad and his life and what he needs with her take no prisoners style and approach.  Add to that the murder and danger to Julia, and the twists provided there and the story becomes one that is hard to put down.Overall I really enjoyed this story and didn&amp;#8217;t find a great lack of information in not reading the first of the series.  Moments of frustration with Julia&amp;#8217;s immaturity were offset by the solid writing and clever details that kept me wondering what would happen next.  And the revelations about Brad&amp;#8217;s secrets were wholly unexpected, just when I thought I knew what they would be, something entirely different popped out and left me cheering the author with a well done.  This is a book and series that you will want to dive into, and not come out until it is complete: and yet there is more to come, as there are still questions to be answered.I received an eBook copy from Media Muscle for purpose of honest review.

Instead of developing an actual plot line this book basically just followed an extremely awkward (but in no way redeeming) freshman in her first year of college at Harvard.  I kept reading expecting an interesting (or at least existent) plot to develop.  But no luck.  Besides the lack of plot, I had issues with the basic writing.  The dialogue was extremely unbelievable (has the author ever heard of a contraction?) and there wasn't one likable character.  I'm really not sure how the book was even published in the first place.

As an Illinois lawyer (like Brooks) of similar age, and longtime fan of Tolkien, CS Lewis, Charles Williams (and, yes, Harry Potter) I have kind of identified with Terry Brooks, and have read all the Shannara books, as well as Word/Void. Though I doubt Brooks's Word/Void series began with a conscious plan to integrate them into the beginnings of the Shannara world, I thought it was really ideal when that effort began. It became apparent in Shannara, as you went along, that its world had evolved from a post-modern apocalypse of some kind, which works well and provides a lot of food for more novels. (I've read Canticle for Liebowitz, Malevil, On the Beach, and a bunch others of that genre as well, and Shannara'a evolution from that world just began to make great sense.) So, I had huge hopes with Genesis that Brooks would link up the world of Word/Void with Shannara. I thought Bearers, and Measure, would finish what Genesis had started in doing that.  But, I thought the resolution was left incomplete. Where was this valley? There was no map included, and I could not situate its only Shannara situs, Arborlon, or exactly where in the valley Arborlon was. I was expecting an ending where Panterra and Prue would vanquish the Ragpicker demon (a masterful villain, written about brilliantly) and go off to found Paranor, and Phryne would marry Pan, abdicate, and join him there, elfstones in tow. But, alas, no Paranor, and no anything else from Shannara except for the unlocatable Arborlon. Measure had me really enthused with the love/sexual relationship (first ever for a Brooks book, I think) between Pan and Phryne. But, then she abruptly leaves him, even doubts her having loved him, and dies, leaving that unresolved, too (though her tragic flaw of impetuousness is somewhat redeemed by her heroism in saving the elves from the trolls.) But how can Phryne be queen, which I thought was going to happen, being dead? Why not at least leave her fate unknown, something for Pan (and the rest of us) to hope for. If a heroine should have died, dare I say let it have been Prue, as the ultimate sacrifice in protecting the life of the comrade whom she deeply (though maybe not yet romantically) loved? But, wasn't Sider enough? It was almost like Game of Thrones, where so many of the sympathetic characters I liked are killed off and taken away from us. Well, the lack of a resolution caused me to drop a star from the rating. Still, Measure did add some, if not enough, substance to the Word/Void - Shannara link, and did at least resolve the undead demon that stalked through from Word/Void, and Genesis, to finally, and thankfully be destroyed in this latest volume. Indeed, Measure has a lot of exciting parts, and I believe it truly merits at least 4 stars. How to fix it from here? Maybe don't leap centuries into the future in your next book, past the latest Shannara era, but bring the Hawk's valley into the Duln forests, or Leah, or somewhere in Shannara, and give us the rest of the transition, the dwarves and the gnomes, and the Southlanders, and Paranor, and link Arborlon to where it is supposed to be. Maybe you can do it through Elven diaries and histories that are somehow discovered preserved and un-decomposed. But, why not instead just add a third book to the Bearer - Measure series? Make the demon either survive in spirit to corrupt some of the Glensk Wood or other folks so that they mutate into the evil beings that Brooks created in Shannara? Lots of possibilities there. Nonetheless, Measure was still good, and deserves to be bought and will provide enjoyment when read if you are any kind of fan of Terry Brooks, and I do recommend it.</td>\n",

Like all Brookner's novels, the hero/ine is solitary, well off, and given to melancholy mental soliloquies. As always, the protagonist's choice of company is unsatisfactory, the few elderly people who have sparsely peopled his past and who are egotistical, selfish and argumentative, or a 50-ish woman who loudly presents claims and demands, amply self justified, of course. So the alternatives are unfulfilling company and the demands that company makes, or isolation and solitary cogitation, indeed fear of dying alone. Brookner skillfully juxtaposes pages of inner thoughts and anxieties, long spun-out indecision, with rapid fire confrontational dialogue as the protagonist tries ineffectively to placate acquaintances who reject his politeness and counter with forthright rudeness and renewed demands. This is a longtime Brookner theme: the quiet, peaceable and well-behaved are at the mercy of charming, gregarious users, out to exploit the quiet householder, turn him out of his or her house in the guise of a short term arrangement, and extract financial advantage from the protagonist's innocent friendship. Though every novel is a variation on this theme, there is no sense of repetition. Miss Brookner's novels are each distinct, each a quiet universe of feeling, with naifs and monsters vying unequally in an indifferent London. Always there is London, bleak, chill, raining, even springtime a disappointment. The protagonist's London is always contrasted with Paris or southern France where he seeks the warm deliverance of the sun. Somehow I never find these novels depressing. Miss Brookner is master of her constricted landscape, but her bleak worldview is not for everyone.</td>\n",

The book is written about three notches below Wikipedia and two notches beneath How Things Work. That makes it perfect if you're looking for understanding without getting into supplemental reading or do it yourself projects to further investigate.I'll add that I found the introduction a bit self-congratulatory and off-putting, particularly with its ode to the wonders of science posed half as rebuke to those who don't agree with scientists (not the same as science) on all matters. It was unnecessary, as the book itself conveys the wonder of the world we live in perfectly well.

I feel like Alaa Al Aswany is capable of shedding light on Egyptian culture and criticism of his Egyptian characters is unwarranted unless you too are from the Middle East.It is more of a set of short stories than I expected.  I found the Arab names hard to remember.  For the first half of the book I had to look back and recall which character belonged to which name.  Alaa Al Aswany develops the characters fully (about 1/2 of the book is devoted to character development) before moving more into their stories.I found the book easy to read if you consider sentence structure and vocabulary.  It was hard to read the first 1/2 only because you to do not get attached to the characters for a until the latter half.  I found it laborious to read but I am thankful I stuck it out.  I felt like I knew the characters intimately when their stories did progress.(I am going to leave out spoilers)There was an Egyptian with an American wife and daughter.  His daughter gets involved with immoral activity.  You get to watch his reaction as he deals with things especially shocking for an Egyptian male.There is a dating couple considering marriage but tempted into making love.  They struggle to do what is acceptable to her parents back in Egypt.The President of Egypt visits Chicago and some characters create plans to promote democracy during his visit.There is a Christian Egyptian who struggles with accusations of abandoning his homeland.There is a couple in which the husband is looking to be promoted within the Egyptian government.The end came with several shocks/surprises that I did not see coming.</td>\n",

In short, Kagan is nostalgic for a circumstance dependent on unnatural conditions (unless, of course, he has decided that War is *healthy*, part of the natural order of things ..).  His call for the U.S. to assume global leadership is all well and good, but it tends to assume strange forms, such as attacking secular leaders in the Islamic world: Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi, President Assad.  One of Kagan's ideological soul-mates, Michael Ledeen, has openly declared that it's not in America's interest to have stability in that part of the world, that instability should be sown whenever possible.  I disagree with that assessment .. and using Kagan's formula - which includes supporting Saudi ideological imperialism - the end result is the rest of the world rooting for the downfall of the United States (a nation-state currently propped up by the military and its dominance of global financial institutions).  The U.S. can either become part of the emerging global economy or risk becoming irrelevant (see also \"the Portuguese Empire\").</td>\n",

Tips are provided with colorful illustrations demonstrating direct and indirect cooking methods, as well as options for smoking and adding a rotisserie.  From there you get into the meat of the book (pun intended) and some very nice recipes.  Honestly a lot the recipes don't seem like \"guy\" type dishes.  I mean I can't see the average backyard cook making Prosciutto wrapped Shrimp for example.  It may be quite good but it's not my cup of tea.  I'd prefer some more stick to your rips type of recipes.

Anne Rice uses this historical period to write a compelling story of one family whose lives are played out against this unique societal tapestry.While today with our contemporary views we may find this societal tapestry difficult to understand, it is certainly worth reading about for the insights into the peculiar situation for free mulatto and quadroon women in New Orleans before the Civil War.

They are all coming of age. It is a summer of discovery for all of them which continues through the following decades that they remain in touch.It begins in the summer of 1974. Julie's father has just passed away, at the untimely age of 42. When she receives a scholarship to attend the camp, Spirit in the Woods, her mom decides it would be good for her to go. While there, she flourishes. When some teens get together in a camp tepee and decide to form a group that will continue to be best friends forever, into the future, she is flattered to be invited to attend; Ash and Goodman, (sister and brother), Jonah, Kathy, Ethan (an animation genius) and Julie, the newbie, round out the circle of six. When they call her Jules, she adopts the name ever after. She does comedy routines at camp and comes out of her shell. She and Ash remain best friends into adulthood and all of them remain friends, throughout the years, periodically getting together again. For the most part, they support each other and are positive influences in each other's lives.The story follows these characters from the summer of Nixon's resignation to the ten year anniversary of 9/11, when they are in their fifties. Each of their lives plays out in a different direction. They remain friends all through the ensuing years, some becoming more successful than others. Each finds their own way. Two of them marry, one is gay, one accuses another of rape, one marries someone outside the circle (Dan), and one runs off and assumes another identity in order to escape the errors of his ways. All of them are fully formed, and we live with them, their failures, successes, mistakes and conflicts as they age and face the exigencies of life.There is some crude language and also there are unnecessary sex scenes which add nothing to the story's development. From my perspective, relevant and important subjects, like intermarriage, motherhood, parental death, divorce, separation, the Aids epidemic, premarital sex, drug use, and even autism, are only casually referenced and not fully explored, while, at the same time, largely irrelevant, liberal political views run rampant, throughout the text, at every opportunity. Wealth and the evil it spawns, coupled with its alter ego, privation, a problem apparently caused by the rich, in the author's view, are mentioned as well. (The expression of the author's personal political views seems to be a very common theme running through the novels today. Authors seem to want to express their personal views and not so subtly plant references to them.)The story is sometimes repetitious as it is retold from different character's points of view as events play out.These are not perfect characters; they have flawed families and imperfect lives, with all of the sundry normal problems and not so normal ones in evidence. They have emotional trauma, mental and physical issues and even legal problems to deal with at various points of the narrative. All of the themes are knitted together in the end when the story comes full circle. There are villains and heroes.In the end, it is about life changes and changing needs as we age. It is about money and the lack of it, what money can buy and what money can destroy. It is about beauty and the lack of it. It is about the relevancy and irrelevancy of issues that sometimes seem so important at one stage of life and so trivial at another. Still, sometimes it takes almost a lifetime to work out the effects of some events in our lives, in order to move forward and live again. Life isn't fair and it isn't a fairy tale. It is not for sissies.Absent the political bias which flies off the pages expressing the author's dislike of conservative politics, it is a really \"interesting\" study of a group of teens as they grow and mature, learn how to make choices, some good and some bad, and come to realize that being \"interesting\" is in the eye of the beholder and its importance depends on circumstances and moments in time. There are many poignant moments, and moments of truth, witnessed by the reader for each of the characters. In the end, most of the characters are altruistic and soon discover that money does not always lift up the rich, but often corrupts them. It is a person's behavior, hopes and dreams that define them, not their money or position or their popularity and beauty.</td>\n",

From the very first appearance of Spidey's black costume during the Secret War (the first and best) to a genuine knock-down-drag-out battle involving Venom and Spider-Man, this collection has a good start. Keep in mind though, it's only a start.If you already own the collection \"Spiderman Versus Venom\", you don't really need this one. There are several crossover issues from both books. And Venom really doesn't play a strong part until about halfway through this collection. We do get a lot of backstory about how the symbiote costume started controlling Peter and how he ultimately rid himself of it before it joined with Eddie Brock. To me, though, Eddie Brock's Venom makes the whole thing worth it. This was before he became the tamer, good guy version of himself later in the comics. This was Eddie when all he wanted to do was eat Spider-Man's liver and such. He was a genuinely scary villain, and probably the best foe Spidey faced during the 90's.I have no doubt there will be a volume 2 of this coming out later because of the abrupt end we have. Don't get me wrong, the story is finished, but there was a lot more history between these two later on.Again, a great collection to get you the Venom backstory.

According to the author's note at the end, there are more installments coming, and I can see him gaining quite the fan following.  I want to give a word of warning though: Old World begins as a fairly standard zombie narrative, but it takes a turn into pure horror that won't be for everyone.The story begins with the Lochlears, a family which has survived the viral zombification of nearly all of the population of England, and the first few chapters introduce us to them and how they are surviving post-zombie apocalypse. They are a nice family, but they've been reduced to survivalism and brutal killing at a moment's notice in order to survive. It's a really interesting premise - trying to be a family while having to give up one's humanity, and the smooth, clear prose makes it quick, interesting reading. This beginning section fits in with the same kind of world as The Walking Dead, and it all seems fairly normal for zombie lit. When the glimmer of other survivors appears, the family hit the road in hope, and that is when the novella takes a distinct turn into truly nasty horror. I didn't see It coming and was pretty shocked. It's not my cup of tea, but Oliver Kennedy controls the scenes well; I just didn't have the stomach for this level of gruesome. I'm not sure it was all necessary, either, but for this style of horror the writing is very strong, and I can see Kennedy is taking the ideas somewhere very interesting. I just might be too faint of heart to follow!</td>\n",

Even when the plot is weak, Chet is always good for a laugh.  Fortunately for fans of the series, this is one of Quinn's better books.A movie is shooting on location in the Valley.  The mayor (prompted by the city's insurance company) hires Bernie to keep an eye on the star.  Thad Perry has a taste for drugs and a knack for getting into trouble.  If the three weeks of filming pass without incident, the town will attract more filmmakers -- or so the mayor believes -- and the city's insurer won't have to pay any claims. Yet once filming begins, trouble of an unexpected nature ensues:  murder.  In the end, three murders come to light (albeit considerably separated in time) and it's up to Bernie and Chet to determine how they are related. Bernie is in charge of deduction; Chet (as he frequently reminds the reader) brings other things to the table.The mystery is a good one, much better than the plot that drove theprevious novelin the series.  Still, the story exists largely as an excuse to give Chet something to talk about.  Chet is the narrator and, as you might expect of a dog, he has trouble staying focused.  Chet's thoughts tend to meander (often in the direction of his next meal) but they always end up in a happy place.  Chet might ponder a profound question for a few moments -- If Bernie has a word on the tip his tongue, why can't Chet see it? How can Bernie's bark be worse than his bite when Bernie doesn't bark? -- but Chet doesn't sweat the small stuff.  His running commentary on life (\"a fluffy white towel can be fun to drag around\") is hilarious.Like all dogs, Chet enjoys eating (ribs are a favorite), napping, and riding in cars.  He has some impulse control issues, particularly when cats are around, but the beauty of Quinn's writing lies in his illumination of the canine mind.  Bernie might think Chet is misbehaving, but Chet's behavior is perfectly natural ... to Chet.  Whether he's shredding the leather seats in Bernie's new Porsche or making an uninvited leap into someone's swimming pool, Chet's actions always make perfect sense ... to Chet.A Fistful of Collars moves at a steady pace and features enough action and detection to satisfy mystery and light thriller fans, but the story is clearly geared to dog lovers.  This is neither a hardcore thriller nor a complex mystery.  The writing is breezy, the language is clean, and humor (invariably generated by Chet's antics and commentary) is the animating force.  New readers can enjoy the story even if they haven't read the earlier installments, but series fans will appreciate the mild intrigue surrounding Bernie's changing relationship with his girlfriend.  Chet doesn't quite understand what that's all about, while readers will have to wait for the next book to learn how Bernie's romantic life will unfold.  Until then, Bernie at least has Chet at his side.If I could, I would give A Fistful of Collars 4 1/2 stars.</td>\n",

Good indexing systems not only store page 'numbers' (specific sites) but also 'locations' within the pages. Thus, one can find a phrase query hit by only looking at a few lines in an index rather than reading through large numbers of web pages. This also easily allows NEAR queries (eg. w/i 5 words of each other), an important component for ranking.The 'rank' of a page turns on relevance, and where query words occur near each other they're more likely to be relevant. HTML uses 'metawords' indicating eg. 'title start,' 'title end' that allow search engines to further improve rankings via explicit consideration of titles.Hyperlinks are phrases on a web page that take one to another page when clicked on - usually highlighted in blue. The number of hyperlinks can be used for ranking, though they can't distinguish between good and bad references within the linked material. The number of pages linked to a particular sources provides a measure of authority. (MacCormick then refers to the 'random surfer' trick to handle circularity.) Unfortunately, people can abuse the hyperlink trick to artificially inflate the ranking of their own web pages by creating large numbers of web pages linking to them, but MacCormick doesn't explain how good search engines discount these. Google now uses over 200 signals in page ranking.Public Key cryptography with 128-bit encryption uses a 38-digit number as it key. In addition, long messages are broken up into small 'blocks' of fixed size, usually 10-15 characters, and each block is then transformed ten or more times per complex rules. The most popular block cipher now is AES.The Diffie-Hellman key exchange system sets up the key for stranger exchanges using prime numbers. Such a system is used whenever a site starts with 'https' instead of 'http.' MacCormick first uses a simplified example involving paint colors to introduce the concepts.Then its on to other subjects. Again, well-done, though not always easy reading.</td>\n",

Sweet and adorable will most likely be the first two words to pop into any reader's head whenever their thoughts turn to Nichole Chase's latest YA novel. Meena lives in the Bahamas with her adopted parents, helping them run their animal shelter, Flukes. Since she's been home schooled her whole life, her biggest worries aren't bullies or boys, but the secret she's hiding. That dynamic changes the moment she meets Blake. Blake is assigned to work at Flukes because of an incident that leaves community service as his only option if he wants to receive his high school diploma. While Meena may believe that staying away from Blake will protect her secret, she learns that maybe her secret isn't in too much danger with him.Flukes flows at a very quick pace filling readers up with romance and mysticism. Blake and Meena ruled this story and every moment that Chase spends on their growing relationship is well spent. However, for readers who love the catch of suspense and strong hints of danger, Flukes doesn't have much of either. The limited amount of conflict in the plot gives the story a breezy feeling, as if anything bad that might happen will be very easy to overcome. Out of the whole novel there's just two or three scenes that provide real conflict in either Meena or Blake's lives and they're short-lived or too simple. The impact could have been much greater on the intensity of the plot, if Chase expounded when it came to relating the issues to readers.Meena's sweetness coupled with Blake's protectiveness takes the novel's romance to a warm, cherishing level. Chase's characters are strong and humorous, giving Flukes a lightness that will make readers sigh with contentment throughout the story.*ebook provided in exchange for an honest review*</td>\n",

The writing's fairly taut and fresh and the plot cracks along but the modern tone, though justified by the surprise plot twist at the end, seems remarkably out of place. We get a fairly good tour of the English (and Welsh) countryside as our reluctant viking protagonist learns to raid and kill in the best tradition of his forebears, gets lost from his raiding party and hooks up with a lovely, if mysterious, female companion and finally finds his shipmates again, only to get swept overboard, with the girl, and end up in the monastery at Lindisfarne just prior to the historical raid on that site which kicked off the full scale viking age in England -- which was to trouble the natives there for the next hundred years or so. We get an oddly bracing picture of these vikings too, professional warriors that they were, as they ready themselves for each upcoming encounter (not unlike the limbering-up exercises of a modern football team about to meet the \"other side\" out on the gridiron in a friendly match) -- you almost have to believe in the realism of it all, despite the warm fuzzy feeling you get once you've really gotten to know these boys. Even Thorfinn Skullsplitter seems like the kind of guy you wouldn't mind splitting a beer with -- assuming that's all he's in the mood for cleaving. But the dragon stuff seems rather forced and out of place. And the end, clever as it is, only adds to the sense that this book and this author didn't quite know where they wanted to go with the story. The protagonist's \"voice\" lapses into a rather sophomoric, counter-cultural patois as the tale winds down, which is both jarring and debilitating to the rest of the tale. And, though it's justified by the ending, the ending itself is discordant with what went before. You may guess it from the way the story moves, but I doubt you'll figure out the locale.The surprise ending in this one seems to have pleased many readers but I found it a bit off-putting, myself, turning what had seemed to me to be a good, and nicely paced, historical yarn into something a bit too self-concious and cute. I prefer my viking tales with a larger dash of authenticity so the abrupt plot twist which brings this one to a close, left me a bit cold.But it's nicely written and holds the reader to the end.SWM</td>\n",

What sets Butcher apart to me is that where many in contemporary publishing start to decline noticeably in the quality of their writing after gaining some success, he hasn't.  In point of fact, he's clearly been working to improve every aspect of his storytelling.Take any component of a good tale - characterization, character development, relationships, dialogue, plot structure and complexity, world-building, internal consistency, and just the craft of creating prose that leads a reader through a series of ideas, thoughts, events in order to build to a conclusion not just of plot but of an IDEA - Jim Butcher has now shown he is capable of doing all of these and doing them well.Without delving into spoilers, the last novel in the series,Changes: A Novel of the Dresden Files, contained Many Significant Events and also illuminated the significance of previous events in new ways.  By the end of the novel, the world the characters lived in had been utterly transformed.This novel was about many things, but the one that stands out above the rest is consequences, using the aftermath of the previous novel as the driving force behind the idea.  Obvious, perhaps, but Butcher comes at it from different directions, giving more depth to it than just a sort of \"A Christmas Carol\" or \"Its a wonderful life\" approach, I thought.I cannot recommend this book strongly enough.  Be warned however, that much of what is to be absorbed from it would be lost without reading the earlier works, preferably in order from book one,Storm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1).  There is a story arc to the Dresden Files and one would be doing oneself a real disservice to read them out of order.</td>\n",

              "      <td>For those who complain that McMurtry's STREETS OF LAREDO didn't have the same feel as LONESOME DOVE, it's a legitimate critique, but it's also one that misses the point.STREETS OF LAREDO is by far a more effective, chilling and worthy book than any of the prequels that McMurtry would later pen about Gus and Call's earlier days (all of them enjoyable reads...but none of them ever managed to recapture the magice of LONESOME DOVE).As far as I'm concerned STREETS OF LAREDO is one of the most terrifying books I've ever read. Some of the scenes of brutality and cruelty are tons more frightening and nightmarish than anything ever penned by Stephen King.LONESOME DOVE...though, no doubt, filled with a gritty realism that has often been lacking in Westerns (either on film or in literature)...did still convey some sense of romance to the Western. Even though LONESOME DOVE is in a leagure of its own, one can still see homage being paid to classics such as RED RIVER, THE GUNFIGHTER, THE COWBOYS and THE SEARCHERS both on page and on film.STREETS OF LAREDO strips away the romance and paints a picture of a dying era.The likes of Woodrow and his peers have become so scarce that it's gotten to the point where a hero such as Charles Goodnight will pause in the desert to have a conversation with a human monster such as John Wesley Hardin (a chilling scene in STREETS OF LAREDO that's akin to the Angel Gabriel and Lucifer meeting face to face).STREETS OF LAREDO is in the same league as the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone or more brutal Westerns such as Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH (and even shares a bit with the theme of the more low-key homage to the dying West that's depicted in THE SHOOTIST). If LONESOME DOVES had its share of heroes who seem bigger than life, STREETS OF LAREDO shares all the grotesque qualities of a Leone Western by filling its landscape with characters barely worthy of life. Disurbingly nightmarish places such as Crow Town in STREETS OF LAREDO would not be at all out of place in one of Leone's MAN WITH NO NAME(Clint Eastwood) TRILOGY.What's especially brilliant about STREETS OF LAREDO is that McMurtry builds up such a grand landscape with so many rich characters in LONESOME DOVE...only to tear apart that terrain, its heroes and its nobility with his sequel. It is a jarring book, for sure. Even though LONESOME DOVE is not without its disturbing &amp; brutal moments, there is a nobility to many of the scenes and characters (which is why it's so well-loved...and will continue to be well-loved for many, many decades). Yet, to make sur that we're not too smitten or swept away by the grandeur of LONESOME DOVE, McMurtry delivered STREETS OF LAREDO as a way of showing us the dark underbelly of the beast that we didn't completely see in LONESOME DOVE. Without Gus riding by Woodrow's side, Captain Call has become every bit as much a shell of a man as Eastwood in the Leone movies (or in UNFORGIVEN). It is not easy to read...and perhaps McMurtry would have left many readers much more happy had he let the LONESOME DOVE saga end with that one book. However, by writing STREETS OF LAREDO McMurty provides the hangover that comes after a night of drunken revalry. It's not an easy read...it strips away the myth &amp; awe that LONESOME DOVE provided to so many...but it is brilliant.With those two books (LONESOME DOVE and STREETS OF LARED0), McMurty managed to go from conjuring up the spirit of John Ford/Howard Hawks to evoking the demons of Leon/Peckinpah.In many ways one could draw a parallel to this pair of books to THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER PART II. Though both GODFATHER films are brutal, one shows the rise of a glorious America...while the other shows its fall (all through the character of Michael Corleone). McMurtry accomplishes the same with LONESOME DOVE (the more glorious time) and STREETS OF LAREDO (the fall of such glory).I mean, finding out within the first dozen pages or so that Newt was killed shortly after the story of LONESOME DOVE ends...that pretty much let the reader know from the word \"go\" that we'd be in for a dark ride with this book.If LONESOME DOVE...even amidst the betrayals, the murders, the senseless killings, the dirt and the grime...managed to speak to the better angels within us, the STREETS OF LAREDO speaks to our demons. With this in mind, I find these two books to complete and complement one another. STREETS OF LAREDO, by its very dark/dim nature, manages to exalt LONESOME DOVE even more.While LONESOME DOVE, through its sweeping majesty, manages to make STREETS OF LAREDO all the more disturbing.As for the other books with Gus &amp; Call...they are entertaining at best... but none of the prequels ever come close to accomplishing the jarring dichotomy that McMurty accomplishes with his pairing of LONESOME DOVE and STREETS OF LAREDO.So, for those who are disappointed or disturbed by STREETS OF LAREDO...I'd suggest that you put a few CDs of Ennio Morricone's Western Themes on the stereo to play in the background while giving this book another reading. You might find that it's in the same league as LONESOME DOVE itself when read this way.</td>\n",

There is a clearly defined mythology, religion, political system, philosophy and ecology in this world.  Despite all the introduced terminology in the book, I feel it is easy enough for the reader to pick up and understand these new terms.Having said that, I did not find the main characters, or many of the other characters, interesting.  Paul and Jessica are unappealing characters because of their seeming penchant for all of their actions to be based on political reasons.  While there is a need for it at times, it seems like all of their actions are made for manuvering their survival on Arrakis.  I feel that the better characters are Gurney Halleck and Dr. Yueh.  Both men have detailed backstories that fully explain their motivations in the actions they take, which are made for a myriad of reasons, not just political.I felt that the book would have benefitted from more of a balance between action and political intrigue.  The action sequences that did take place were ok, and would have kept my interest more.I realize that I am in the minority with my opinion of Dune.  I give Herbert a lot of credit for creating a fully imagined and detailed world, and this novel was no doubt groundbreaking at the time of publication.

It did, which is why I gave it four stars instead of three.  But even though I'm giving it four stars, this book has an equal amount of pros and cons.  I'll start with the cons.1. Way too much internal dialogue--the babble dragged on and on.  Tru is constantly hashing over her blasted feelings, repeating the same thoughts throughout.  I would've enjoyed more actual dialogue between the characters or just edit it out all together.  I skipped countless paragraphs of insignificant mind chatter.2.  A bit juvenile at times with the love triangle scenes.  The bar scene with Will, Tru, and Jake is of a high school mindset.  I know Towle was trying not to depicted Tru as a callous harlot, but the way she lied to Will and her reasoning behind it was just ... well ... straight out of high school.3.  The name The Mighty Storm.  I kept thinking about the Christopher Guest mockumentary, A Mighty Wind.  Hilarious movie but I didn't want to associate it with a sexy rockstar romance.Pros:1.  Towle can write a solid love story and create an alluring lead man, or should I say, lead rockstar.  Jake was a hotty, and I fell hard for this sexy piece of guitar-playing-ass.  Although Tru, IMO, comes across as the two-timing tramp at times, I liked her too.  I was cheering the couple on from the get go.2.  Dialogue.  I wanted more of it!!  I loved the exchanges between Tru and Jake.  Their conversations made me blush, giggle with anticipation, shed a tear (from anger and joy), and feel strongly connected to both. This is why the book lingered in my thoughts--great exchanges between the pair.3.  The famous rockstar premise has a provocative draw--I enjoyed getting sucked into their world.  It was fun escapism!</td>\n",

All the text in between is just filler going around in circles.As a non-vampire fan who bought this on impulse, a lot still confuses me after the book ended and the author makes no attempt to explain or resolve the issue. For example, aren't people bound to notice that the Lizzy and Darcy aren't getting any older as the years pass? How are they planning to explain this?

This story was a bit different in that the heroine isn't all that likable in the beginning and a bit evil/ruthless. That was kind of hard to swallow at first. She grows on you though as you read it. I usually like my men to be the evil ones and the women to reform them but this was reversed. I probably would have given it 5 stars if it had been the other way around. If you haven't read any of Kresley Cole's books you have to start because they are fantastic.</td>\n",

              "      <td>As I type this, I've already started in on the second book in this series via audiobook. It's a pretty entertaining series and I can see where Collins's work has had a particularly large influence on the dystopian genre as a whole. You can argue that there's better out there or more well known works, but this was exactly what such an under-noticed genre needed to fully push itself into mainstream notice, just as Twilight was what YA PNR/UF needed to gain traction.The basic premise here is actually pretty horrific for a teen/children's novel. You have a society that is constantly kept on the brink of starvation due to the seemingly selfish actions of an Orwellian government that is always watching for signs of rebellion. Despite there having been a potential mass extinction event, the world outside of the Districts is relatively full of life sustaining wild foods and game- which suggests that starvation could potentially be avoided if not for the Capitol's mandate that nobody stray outside of the walls. There was a rebellion, but it was squashed and in retaliation the Capitol essentially requires that every District send two children to the Hunger Games to fight each other semi-gladiator style for their amusement. The wealthier districts, the ones who can afford to train their children from birth and always seem to have enough to eat, don't mind this as much as the poorer districts who live day to day and enter the games emaciated- ensuring their defeat and deaths.It's into this type of world that we see Katniss, a girl who can't afford to be sentimental but is devoted to her family. She enters the games due to her love for her sister and ends up getting caught up in the various games the Capitol has to offer both in and out of the arena. Katniss is forced to agree to a rather twisted ploy for survival: to fake love with Peeta to gain support from various benefactors. This is actually fairly interesting, as many novels of this like would have her instantly falling for Peeta at first sight and there being obvious protestations of love from the get go. This might be spoilerish, but as there's tons of reviews of the book and movie commenting on their relationship I think that most will already be aware of the basic spoilers. Katniss takes a lot of convincing to even acknowledge what basic emotions she does feel, which I liked. The story in this first book isn't really about romance, it's about survival and personal freedoms first and foremost. It's obvious that romance will eventually become a main thrust of the series, but right here and now it's just having the groundwork laid for future love triangles and developments. I respect this, as most times you have the romance between the various characters be the central focus of the series, with anything else being there just to highlight how in \"wub\" the two main characters are. It's nice to have something that has the romance as something to accent a more major and more pressing plot point.This book isn't entirely perfect, mind you. There are points where the plot does seem to be a little overly extended and some readers will undoubtedly be frustrated with a general lack of detail about a lot of elements in the novel. As the book's focus is survival, we're given only what is most pertinent to the moment as far as back story goes for Panem in general. It makes sense that there wouldn't be gobs of info drops, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating at times. Having a little more description about how rough life is would make it more understanding to have someone around Katniss's age or the wonderfully tragic Rue's age act so mature. Their maturity is sometimes at odds with how they act, which both helps and hurts things. It reminds us that they're still kids but it'd also be good to show that these characters never had time to be kids.Ultimately though, this is a great book and the narration here is very well done. If you have a chance to listen to this as opposed to reading it, I highly recommend it. McCormick is pretty talented and I loved how she voiced Haymitch.</td>\n",

Unfortunately, it was wrapped around a fairly conventional story that, ultimately, didn't take the reader particularly far or anywhere particularly unpredictable.  But boy, what stories about the industry...\",\n          \"Flukes is a lovely novel. Sweet and adorable will most likely be the first two words to pop into any reader's head whenever their thoughts turn to Nichole Chase's latest YA novel. Meena lives in the Bahamas with her adopted parents, helping them run their animal shelter, Flukes. Since she's been home schooled her whole life, her biggest worries aren't bullies or boys, but the secret she's hiding. That dynamic changes the moment she meets Blake. Blake is assigned to work at Flukes because of an incident that leaves community service as his only option if he wants to receive his high school diploma. While Meena may believe that staying away from Blake will protect her secret, she learns that maybe her secret isn't in too much danger with him.Flukes flows at a very quick pace filling readers up with romance and mysticism. Blake and Meena ruled this story and every moment that Chase spends on their growing relationship is well spent. However, for readers who love the catch of suspense and strong hints of danger, Flukes doesn't have much of either. The limited amount of conflict in the plot gives the story a breezy feeling, as if anything bad that might happen will be very easy to overcome. Out of the whole novel there's just two or three scenes that provide real conflict in either Meena or Blake's lives and they're short-lived or too simple. The impact could have been much greater on the intensity of the plot, if Chase expounded when it came to relating the issues to readers.Meena's sweetness coupled with Blake's protectiveness takes the novel's romance to a warm, cherishing level. Chase's characters are strong and humorous, giving Flukes a lightness that will make readers sigh with contentment throughout the story.*ebook provided in exchange for an honest review*\",\n          \"Yes, she was a mess. She had an almost insatiable hunger for love combined with ridiculous taste in men. She had a short attention span. She was, as Brown points out again and again, \\\"a tactician,\\\" who often exhibited reckless disregard for the long-term consequences of her actions. All true.And yet, even after all this is disclosed, the woman we see is am ambitious, empathic woman, a mother who loves her sons, and a charismatic force of nature with a nearly undefeatable spirit. I don't know if it's Brown's writing or the power of Diana's personality that make her someone you root for, even as she races toward that sad end in Paris.My biggest quibble with the book is NOT ENOUGH PHOTOS. Over and over, Brown makes reference to this iconic photograph, or to that famous dress she wore, or how Diana's style changed to reflect her evolving personality ... and it would be nice if those photos were included in the book. I found this frustrating.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Actual Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          1,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Predicted Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          3,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
