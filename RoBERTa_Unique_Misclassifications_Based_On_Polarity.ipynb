I'm trying to like this book, it had so many good reviews.  I have some of this author's other cookbooks, have been very pleased.  On the plus side, the recipes look very healthy.   \n",

I thought it was a little heavy on the nitty-gritty of the investigation and a little light on story and plot, but if you're a CSI fan, you will probably enjoy it.  I did.   \n",

Almost didn't finish it, but I'm glad I did because the end was the best part of the book, nicely wrapping up all of the various plot ends.  I didn't know enough about abalone to care about their poaching, my problem, but it wasn't until mid-book that there was a brief explanation of why they were even a product anyone would want to poach, and why I should care. And what about all of the shells, doesn't someone want to make jewelry and buttons?  The main character Marquez, game warden, didn't have the flair of some other game wardens I have read and reviewed lately.  Perhaps the plodding day to day activity more accurately reflects the life, but it doesn't make for an exciting read. The pregnant partner not wanting to go on desk duty was too obvious that something ill fated was in store for her.  That was the only tension: when is this going to happen.  The attempt to make informer Davies believably eccentric fell short in that, like all of the characters, he needed more fleshing out.  The best and redeeming part of the book is when Marquez talks to his step daughter about her depression and eating disorder (if only it were that easy, but still perhaps helpful to some in similar situations). I think the basic idea was sound, just needed something more...maybe some more use of dialog to set up characters and less brief descriptions of the action.   \n",

The author made Christian Grey likable by making him truly sincere, decent, and loving. He is also a self-made billionaire at 27 and a complete sex-expert. He speaks fluent French and plays the piano like a pro. Oh, and obviously he is a brilliant Harvard drop-out. Clearly, Christian is the hottest emotional mess with mommy issues the author could possibly come up with. In real life, though, people like him are also self-absorbed narcissists and ruthless sociopaths, so what women should do when they come across somebody like him is run as far away from him as they can. There's some obsession in our society with dysfunctional personalities, which I do not seem to share. I heard that in the second book they have a vanilla relationship, so maybe the second book is worth reading more than the first one.   \n",

Deveraux is employed as a public defender, but is rescued from the world of arraignments because of his privileged past, and is allowed to second-seat the head of the office as defense counsel on a murder trial.This writer doesn't want to give the story away, but the narrative does ring true as a real story of a real lawyer, except perhaps when the criminals in the story use criminal slang ten times too many.  The title refers to the fact that most criminal activity occurs at night, so if one could find \"A Cure for Night\" there would be little need for criminal defense.Early in the book, Joel and the paralegal discuss the prospects for her entering law school, and it is clear then that anyone should think very carefully about whether they are suited for the practice of law.  By the suspenseful end, Joel has certainly figured this out.   \n",

It is really part cookbook and part fun read, however, as much of the book is taken up with the recipes.  After reading it, I passed it on to a friend who is from Nashville and who enjoys the southern culture and cooking.  Enjoy it for a light read and a few laughs but know that it contains more recipes than anything else.   \n",

It's got lots of glossy pictures of delicious-looking cakes and an extensive guide on cooking implements. Yup, beautiful.Now, I did expect, coming from a very famous, skilled chef, to get a book that wasn't exactly what you'd call simple. Of course, his experience was going to show somewhere so no, I didn't expect easy stuff. But I'm something of an avid baker so even if I don't have any professional training, I do pretty well in the kitchen. Imagine my surprise when several of his recipes did flop on me. This is ridiculous! I'm one to follow instructions to the best of my abilities but I think he takes for granted that you know so much more on so many levels than any non-chef does. I never did try the failed recipes again but did try others and fared a little better. They really are delicious.  Still, I don't like thinking when I start baking that there's a 50% chance that the recipe may not come out well.Never had any trouble at all baking extensively from other books. This one, I'm getting a little bit better but by trial and error, not through useful insight gained from the book. But the best part, this book does inspire me to keep trying.I'll get your cakes yet, Nick Malgieri!   \n",
              "14  Tintin is sent by his Brussels newspaper to expose the true conditions of life in Bolshevik Russia, and counter the propaganda spread by Soviets and their Western fellow-travellers.  Together with his faithful fox terrier Snowy, Tintin finds famine, child hunger, bureaucratic incompetence, industrial failure, bogus propaganda, state terror, gunpoint elections and massive embezzlement of the people's wealth by the government.  Naturally, the Soviets aren't terribly keen for such information to leak out, and attempt to dispatch our hero at every turn - trying to bomb, shoot at, torture and freeze him in the endless snowy Steppes.'Tintin In The Land Of The Soviets' is the first Tintin adventure, written in 1929 for a Catholic newspaper edited by a priest who would become a Nazi collaborator.  The book's propaganda is crude - as the translators point out, Herge never visited Russia, and based his 'facts' on a contemporary, reactionary book by a Belgian consul - and leaves a sour taste in the mouth.  It's not that what he shows wasn't accurate - his Soviet Russia is a totalitarian nightmare, swarming with vicious secret police; a place where citizens had their property stolen and labour abused; where starvation, torture and murder was rife; where more state effort went into destruction than construction.  The book is filled with booze-sozzled goons are frightening precisely because they have a power they don't deserve.  A lingering superstitiousness undermines this brave new world, and the images are full of delapidation and things crashing and falling apart - nothing can possibly work in such an environment.  The 'Wizard of Oz'-like scene where a guide shows gullible English communists industrial marvels that are really two men billowing smoke and rattling sheet metal, is horribly accurate.  This comic look at misery and tyranny looks forward to the Czech films of the 60s.  Nonetheless, the book never becomes satire, never moves beyond popular prejudices - the critique in 'Tintin In America' is far more effective because Herge displays a more thorough knowledge of and engagement with US history and culture.The 'Tintin's we are familiar with now - painstakingly illustrated, beautifully coloured and meticulously detailed albums - only came into being in the mid-40s: earlier editions were redrafted and edited to fit the new format.  This book was the only one Herge didn't remodel, perhaps embarrassed in retrospect by its crass ideology.  Reading 'Soviets' after one of the later 'Tintin's is like watching an Ub Iwerks cartoon after 'Toy Story'.  The drawing is sometimes cruder and much less detailed than we're used to, like a loose-limbed 'Peanuts' strip.  Instead of the four strips of four columns of the later books, there are three strips of two columns - each frame is much larger and seems to lunge at the reader.  The positioning of speech bubbles is often clumsy; frequently, characters redundantly say what we can clearly see; the angle of compositions sometimes works against the action - all this can prevent a fluid reading.  Tintin himself is a different beast - beefier, more aggressive, even high-handed with a splendidly cynical Snowy - he roughs up a Cheka agent, easily dispatches a vodka-guzzling bear, and trips up passers-by whenever the need arises.Despite these flaws, 'Soviets' is a pacy and funny adventure.  Two things Herge arrived with fully formed were: his ability to express speed within and across frames; and his fascination with gorgeous moving vehicles (motorcars, trains, planes, boats) stretching across the plate.   \n",

It makes you wonder how this girl ever managed to grow up to be a decent upstanding daughter with a mother who was an alcoholic that never could accept being left behind , a father who put more into his career than he did his family and a step mother who tried her best to be the picture of a loving mother. Really is a good book.   \n",

I'm not a fan of short stories, especially short romances - girl always gets guy with no conflict whatsoever. This story was an advertisement for a charity helping single mothers, which was annoying. How hard the life is for single mothers was over-emphasized - it became a bit preachy by the end of the story. Hello, why not single parents? Why just single mothers? Single dads have the same issues (child care, time off from work for sick kids, having to do it all, etc.). Bottom-line - it's free, reading it passed the time, and since it was short, the preaching ended before it was too annoying. Just be aware of what you're getting - this is not the usual Robin Carr, which I really enjoy.   \n",

Why did I keep reading? Bored I guess.  The story goes back and forth between two different people Hahp and Sadima. It gets you really mad with most of the characters expecially Somiss. Hardly anything possitive happens and you keep reading hoping that this depressing book will get better. I'm not always looking for happy endings but geesh.... This was bad.   \n",

I loved the first two books and didn't really care for the last one at all, so probably won't read the others, if any are forthcoming. It's like the author got lost after book 2 and now doesn't know how to end it. I read the sample from book 4 and was bored with the repetitious nature within 40 pages - think it's played out.   \n",

The authors take the history of Freemasonry (actually, the mystic legends that surround Freemasonry) and tie it to the &quot;real&quot; story of Jesus Christ. When you link conspiracies to Christianity, you're going to get under someone's skin.But few books are as fascinating to read as this one. Think of it as one-third truth and two-thirds speculation. If the authors called it a fictional account --- a fantasy about the way things might be --- the result would be a strange sort of historical novel. It's wouldn't be as compelling. Instead, they present this story as nonfiction, breathlessly uncovering the greatest secret in the history of mankind. It's an approach that keeps you reading. In the end, you'll enjoy the story as a series of curious &quot;what if&quot; possibilities. If half of this is true, the world is more interesting than you thought.   \n",

Could Cornwell create new characters as likeable and intriguing as Scarpetta et al?  Hornet's Nest was interesting, a good read,  but Southern Cross goes just a bit too far -- I found myself wondering if I  was reading a serious crime novel or a spoof of a crime novel. The plot is  a bit of a stretch, and overall, the book lacks a certain edge that  Cornwell has consistently demonstrated in her Scarpetta novels.   \n",

Frederica has been raised by liberal college professor parents and is just beginning to rebel against their egalitarian child rearing practises when her father's unscrupulous and melodramatic ex-wife arrives on campus to stir things up in their well-ordered lives.Elinor Lipman is one of my favorite contemporary authors; her books are funny in an understated way, character driven, with ironic plot twists and satirical observations of modern life. If you click on the other Amazon reviews, you will find reviews that get rather defensive about why funny books can also be very good literature and why women's books can rise above chic-lit, but still be popular, and why Elinor Lipman has devoted fans but really ought to be a best-selling author and is under appreciated. And of course the nod to Jane Austen to whom all good women authors who write comedies of manners or anything close are compared. Leaving aside the defensiveness about humor and the obsession with Austen as the standard for all women's writing, you should read Lipman's books if you like a sardonic look at modern life. Readers don't have to suffer through oh-so-serious tomes to enjoy good literature. To find out more about her, read some of her essays posted on her website.   \n",

A really great storyline but just too slow and unromantic for my part. Definitely a good on  for most other readers though so enjoy.   \n",

First, the narrator, Essie, makes the following disclaimer within the first few pages: \"You''ll say I wasn't everywhere; you'll say there's no way I can know all that I've depicted. But I stand by all the truths in this story of deception.\" Unfortunately, just because you acknowledge upfront the improbabilities in the narrative given the author's chosen point of view, that doesn't make the improbabilities go away. That disclaimer actually makes things worse since it calls attention to the novel's big flaw.And I'm not sure if what I'm about to say will make much sense. This isn't by any means a bad book. In fact this book is quite well written. But it is written in the identical polished prose that I come across in so much serious contemporary literature. And for me it is becoming a little boring. I suppose what I'm talking about is style, or the lack thereof. For me this isn't a distinct or unique voice.   \n",

After the Battle of Loos he convalesced in Hampshire. A telegram summoned him to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Walter Bullivant. There is a potential danger from the Turkish Empire against the Allies. Hannay is to travel there to learn about this menace (Chapter 1). Hannay picks two aides: Sandy Arbuthnot and John S. Blenkiron (Chapter 2). In Portugal Hannay meets Peter Pienaar and takes him along (Chapter 3). They all travel into Germany and meet Ulric von Stumm (Chapter 4). The next two chapters tell of their travels in Germany. Hannay makes his escape and finds a refuge in the snowstorm (Chapter 7). He left to find a boat on the Danube (Chapter 8). Hannay finds Peter Pienaar and takes him aboard (Chapter 9). They arrive in Constantinople and find it eventful (Chapter 10). Will they be caught by their enemies (Chapter 11)?They rejoin Sandy and John. Germany wants to control the Near East (Chapter12). Hannay now poses as an American (Chapter 13). When Peter and Richard are lost at night they find a house and are directed back to the city (Chapter 14). A meeting with a Turkish officer creates a dangerous situation. Hilda von Einem visits him (Chapter 15). They all travel towards Erzerum and their motorcar breaks down (Chapter16). They steal another car to continue their journey but are arrested (Chapter 17). They are able to escape to a house outside the city (Chapter 18). Can they get the military secrets to the Russians (Chapter 19)? Chapter 20 tells how Peter crossed No-Man's Land in the night to reach the Russians. Richard and his friends try to escape to the Russian lines but are trapped on a hill (Chapter 21). Just as it seems hopeless the Russian guns and Cossack cavalry sweep away the Turkish army and German troops to provide a happy ending (Chapter 22). [Will this counteract the defeat at Gallipolli?]This was written in 1916, a bad year for the Allies. The German air force dominated the skies, until more advanced airplanes were produced for the French and British. This book can be viewed as propaganda for the Allied cause, a wish for the Russians to defeat Germany and come west. It points out the German interest in the oil-rich lands of the then Turkish Empire. Details of this story seem dated, but provides a view into the culture. John Buchan was a writer, barrister, member of Parliament, partner in a publishing house, a Church of Scotland official, and Governor-General of Canada. Few novelists have such a background.   \n",

We know who did it, but it was never stated in the book, therefore left with loose ends.Other than that, it was a very good book with many lines of suspense, and in the end our friend, Harry Bosch, comes out all right.   \n",

I did notice a few spelling errors that really did bother me. Don't people proof read before publishing a book? I did love the characters names! Avery and Cam make a great couple.   \n",

It's very well written and unlike many digital books, it was almost free of typos and miss-used words.  I read this type of novel for the mystery and crime interest rather than romance.  I appreciated the relationship that developed between the lead female and the male ex-cop, but I skimmed multiple paragraphs in order to avoid reading the descriptions of the love-making scenes.   \n",

I chose this book because I have read all the other books in the series and wanted to see what happens next.Rebecca Myles keeps her private life and her work life far apart as possible. She was badly hurt by her last Dom which has made her wary of getting into any serious relationship in general. She is a very smart and confident woman. She knows what she wants in her professional life and goes for it.Tyler Stone is not used to being turned down when I comes to business. He only wants the best and gets it. He is a handsome and dominating personality in and out of the bedroom.One of the problems I had with this story was it is unrealistic that a boss is close friends to be invited to a gathering outside of work. Especially a company the size that was depicted. In addition, who really wants there boss to see them outside of work? Maybe I am different but work is work and personal life is personal life.The chemistry between Rebecca and Tyler was off the charts. The sex scenes are very hot and spicy but there were not enough BDSM elements. I did not get the sensory deprivation tank. I know some people enjoy it but it was not believable that she adjusted so well in her first trip inside the tank.This was a very well written story. I wish there was more description of BDSM elements in their relationship. Overall, this was a wonderful story and a great addition to the story. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series.   \n",

And the best part is that it's got little quotes from fathers throughout, including the most anguished, troubled kinds of dilemmas, making me feel more human for my difficulty rising to the challenge sometimes. One Dad laments, \"It all seems like a blur. I sometimes have to fight very hard to remember what he was like even one month or one week ago. Every time I turn around, he's doing something new. I don't want to miss anything. It all makes me wonder whether I've been around enough.\" But then beautiful moments too, \"She screams with delight and babbles incessantly. Who knows what she's thinking.\" \"My son's crawling. He comes bouncing up to me, smiling his head off. It cracks me up, and I laugh hysterically. He crawls right up on my lap and nibbles my nose.\" I'd grade this a B.   \n",

I really enjoy the early Sharpe work that Mr. Cornwell has written and his King Arthur trilogy is one of the most stirring accomplishments of the last 50 years. BUT Thomas of Hookton is no Richard Sharpe and the Grail is no Excalibur.  'Vagabond' is uneven in places with no real sense of 'quest' about it.  For all the roaming around our hero does, he seems to be jogging in place.  The killing of two characters from the earlier book is pointless and does nothing to further the story except clear the way for Thomas' former lover to return.  By the way, how many sieges must we read about?  This book has one at the beginning and one at the end.  Most redundant, considering we have already experienced a siege in 'The Archers Tale'.  Wait till the paperback comes out.   \n",

But when Becca's best friend Heather begs her to help prove that her parents are not enemies of the State, Becca starts to spy on her mother, suspecting her of arranging false confessions which cause innocent people to be tortured.Becca is a good character. She is honest and loyal, refusing to believe that Heather and her parents are the enemy, even when the whole school is against them. You can imagine how you would feel if your best friends parents were in this kind of trouble and you would want to help or believe it was all a mistake. Becca's snooping and her unguarded comments to her mother and friends is showing dissident traits which could see her executed if she is reported but she won't abandon her principles for an easier life, even if it is safer. I found Heather to be frustrating and a bit too changable to like but her character again is well written. When Jake comes on the scene, you are never too sure about him or his motivations which adds a bit of interest. The character that interested me the most was Becca's mother as we see different sides to her through the book that I liked. She is afraid of her daughter's behaviour and has to juggle loyalty to her with the demands of her job. She was complex and fun to read about and I think Becca's view of her mother is a bit unfair at times.The book flows nicely with no big info dumps or pointless descriptions. It is simple and effective character based storytelling which I like to see in a book. I also felt that the length of the book was just right. Adding more to it may have made the book feel too slow and having less would have resulted in missing out on the complex evolving of each character. It is good to see the author get the balance right.Plot wise, I liked the twists and turns as you are never quite sure what is going to be coming next. It gives you a real idea of what it would be like to live in this suspicious world where everyone is watching you to see that you conform to the government way of thinking. At the same time, the setting for the book is very much like the present day which lets the reader imagine that this could actually happen to them and lets them relate to the characters and their struggles. I like that the characters are flawed and make bad decisions.Overall this was a good novella/short book for YA and adult fans of dystopian books. No sexual scenes or f bombs every page.I rate this book 3 out of 5 on my star rating which is different to this site.1-didn't like2-ok3-like4-really liked5-loved   \n",

They were cute reads just not enough to truly pull it together. Have to say its not worth a reread. :(   \n",

It was full of facts on health benefits (most chiles do have capsicum which provide all sorts of healing benefits), and the recipes were mouthwatering. My only gripe was the book needed some editing, and it would have seen much more authoritative. John McDonalds get an A+++ for enthusiasm, and I love how he teaches you to make your own tasty Sriracha. If the book gets the edits it needs, I'd definitely bump up my star rating. Don't let the editorial issues dissuade you, though. What he lacks in this, he totally makes up for in love and enthusiasm!Disclosure: I received the book for the purposes of the review, but opinions are 100% mine and not influenced by other parties.   \n",

This book is certainly the deep end of the pool. It is the culmination of fifteen years' of scholarly research and is presented as a detailed apologetical of his faith. Of its 1000+ pages, 400 are appendices and notes.SACRED FIRE is so big it requires its own luggage. I had to valet check it. Not for the casual reader or faint of heart. But if someone ever challenges the fact that Washington was a Christian, you can whack him in the head with this book: it is pursuasive.   \n",

And what about all of the shells, doesn't someone want to make jewelry and buttons?  The main character Marquez, game warden, didn't have the flair of some other game wardens I have read and reviewed lately.  Perhaps the plodding day to day activity more accurately reflects the life, but it doesn't make for an exciting read. The pregnant partner not wanting to go on desk duty was too obvious that something ill fated was in store for her.  That was the only tension: when is this going to happen.  The attempt to make informer Davies believably eccentric fell short in that, like all of the characters, he needed more fleshing out.  The best and redeeming part of the book is when Marquez talks to his step daughter about her depression and eating disorder (if only it were that easy, but still perhaps helpful to some in similar situations). I think the basic idea was sound, just needed something more...maybe some more use of dialog to set up characters and less brief descriptions of the action.</td>\n",

Clearly, Christian is the hottest emotional mess with mommy issues the author could possibly come up with.

Deveraux is employed as a public defender, but is rescued from the world of arraignments because of his privileged past, and is allowed to second-seat the head of the office as defense counsel on a murder trial.This writer doesn't want to give the story away, but the narrative does ring true as a real story of a real lawyer, except perhaps when the criminals in the story use criminal slang ten times too many.  The title refers to the fact that most criminal activity occurs at night, so if one could find \"A Cure for Night\" there would be little need for criminal defense.Early in the book, Joel and the paralegal discuss the prospects for her entering law school, and it is clear then that anyone should think very carefully about whether they are suited for the practice of law.  By the suspenseful end, Joel has certainly figured this out.</td>\n",

Together with his faithful fox terrier Snowy, Tintin finds famine, child hunger, bureaucratic incompetence, industrial failure, bogus propaganda, state terror, gunpoint elections and massive embezzlement of the people's wealth by the government.  Naturally, the Soviets aren't terribly keen for such information to leak out, and attempt to dispatch our hero at every turn - trying to bomb, shoot at, torture and freeze him in the endless snowy Steppes.'Tintin In The Land Of The Soviets' is the first Tintin adventure, written in 1929 for a Catholic newspaper edited by a priest who would become a Nazi collaborator.  The book's propaganda is crude - as the translators point out, Herge never visited Russia, and based his 'facts' on a contemporary, reactionary book by a Belgian consul - and leaves a sour taste in the mouth.  It's not that what he shows wasn't accurate - his Soviet Russia is a totalitarian nightmare, swarming with vicious secret police; a place where citizens had their property stolen and labour abused; where starvation, torture and murder was rife; where more state effort went into destruction than construction.  The book is filled with booze-sozzled goons are frightening precisely because they have a power they don't deserve.  A lingering superstitiousness undermines this brave new world, and the images are full of delapidation and things crashing and falling apart - nothing can possibly work in such an environment.  The 'Wizard of Oz'-like scene where a guide shows gullible English communists industrial marvels that are really two men billowing smoke and rattling sheet metal, is horribly accurate.  This comic look at misery and tyranny looks forward to the Czech films of the 60s.  Nonetheless, the book never becomes satire, never moves beyond popular prejudices - the critique in 'Tintin In America' is far more effective because Herge displays a more thorough knowledge of and engagement with US history and culture.The 'Tintin's we are familiar with now - painstakingly illustrated, beautifully coloured and meticulously detailed albums - only came into being in the mid-40s: earlier editions were redrafted and edited to fit the new format.  This book was the only one Herge didn't remodel, perhaps embarrassed in retrospect by its crass ideology.  Reading 'Soviets' after one of the later 'Tintin's is like watching an Ub Iwerks cartoon after 'Toy Story'.  The drawing is sometimes cruder and much less detailed than we're used to, like a loose-limbed 'Peanuts' strip.  Instead of the four strips of four columns of the later books, there are three strips of two columns - each frame is much larger and seems to lunge at the reader.  The positioning of speech bubbles is often clumsy; frequently, characters redundantly say what we can clearly see; the angle of compositions sometimes works against the action - all this can prevent a fluid reading.  Tintin himself is a different beast - beefier, more aggressive, even high-handed with a splendidly cynical Snowy - he roughs up a Cheka agent, easily dispatches a vodka-guzzling bear, and trips up passers-by whenever the need arises.Despite these flaws, 'Soviets' is a pacy and funny adventure.  Two things Herge arrived with fully formed were: his ability to express speed within and across frames; and his fascination with gorgeous moving vehicles (motorcars, trains, planes, boats) stretching across the plate.</td>\n",

The authors take the history of Freemasonry (actually, the mystic legends that surround Freemasonry) and tie it to the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; story of Jesus Christ. When you link conspiracies to Christianity, you're going to get under someone's skin.But few books are as fascinating to read as this one. Think of it as one-third truth and two-thirds speculation. If the authors called it a fictional account --- a fantasy about the way things might be --- the result would be a strange sort of historical novel. It's wouldn't be as compelling. Instead, they present this story as nonfiction, breathlessly uncovering the greatest secret in the history of mankind. It's an approach that keeps you reading. In the end, you'll enjoy the story as a series of curious &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; possibilities. If half of this is true, the world is more interesting than you thought.</td>\n",

Frederica has been raised by liberal college professor parents and is just beginning to rebel against their egalitarian child rearing practises when her father's unscrupulous and melodramatic ex-wife arrives on campus to stir things up in their well-ordered lives.Elinor Lipman is one of my favorite contemporary authors; her books are funny in an understated way, character driven, with ironic plot twists and satirical observations of modern life. If you click on the other Amazon reviews, you will find reviews that get rather defensive about why funny books can also be very good literature and why women's books can rise above chic-lit, but still be popular, and why Elinor Lipman has devoted fans but really ought to be a best-selling author and is under appreciated. And of course the nod to Jane Austen to whom all good women authors who write comedies of manners or anything close are compared. Leaving aside the defensiveness about humor and the obsession with Austen as the standard for all women's writing, you should read Lipman's books if you like a sardonic look at modern life. Readers don't have to suffer through oh-so-serious tomes to enjoy good literature. To find out more about her, read some of her essays posted on her website.</td>\n",

That disclaimer actually makes things worse since it calls attention to the novel's big flaw.And I'm not sure if what I'm about to say will make much sense. This isn't by any means a bad book.

A telegram summoned him to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Walter Bullivant. There is a potential danger from the Turkish Empire against the Allies. Hannay is to travel there to learn about this menace (Chapter 1). Hannay picks two aides: Sandy Arbuthnot and John S. Blenkiron (Chapter 2). In Portugal Hannay meets Peter Pienaar and takes him along (Chapter 3). They all travel into Germany and meet Ulric von Stumm (Chapter 4). The next two chapters tell of their travels in Germany. Hannay makes his escape and finds a refuge in the snowstorm (Chapter 7). He left to find a boat on the Danube (Chapter 8). Hannay finds Peter Pienaar and takes him aboard (Chapter 9). They arrive in Constantinople and find it eventful (Chapter 10). Will they be caught by their enemies (Chapter 11)?They rejoin Sandy and John. Germany wants to control the Near East (Chapter12). Hannay now poses as an American (Chapter 13). When Peter and Richard are lost at night they find a house and are directed back to the city (Chapter 14). A meeting with a Turkish officer creates a dangerous situation. Hilda von Einem visits him (Chapter 15). They all travel towards Erzerum and their motorcar breaks down (Chapter16). They steal another car to continue their journey but are arrested (Chapter 17). They are able to escape to a house outside the city (Chapter 18). Can they get the military secrets to the Russians (Chapter 19)? Chapter 20 tells how Peter crossed No-Man's Land in the night to reach the Russians. Richard and his friends try to escape to the Russian lines but are trapped on a hill (Chapter 21). Just as it seems hopeless the Russian guns and Cossack cavalry sweep away the Turkish army and German troops to provide a happy ending (Chapter 22). [Will this counteract the defeat at Gallipolli?]This was written in 1916, a bad year for the Allies. The German air force dominated the skies, until more advanced airplanes were produced for the French and British. This book can be viewed as propaganda for the Allied cause, a wish for the Russians to defeat Germany and come west. It points out the German interest in the oil-rich lands of the then Turkish Empire. Details of this story seem dated, but provides a view into the culture. John Buchan was a writer, barrister, member of Parliament, partner in a publishing house, a Church of Scotland official, and Governor-General of Canada. Few novelists have such a background.</td>\n",

I chose this book because I have read all the other books in the series and wanted to see what happens next.Rebecca Myles keeps her private life and her work life far apart as possible. She was badly hurt by her last Dom which has made her wary of getting into any serious relationship in general. She is a very smart and confident woman. She knows what she wants in her professional life and goes for it.Tyler Stone is not used to being turned down when I comes to business. He only wants the best and gets it. He is a handsome and dominating personality in and out of the bedroom.One of the problems I had with this story was it is unrealistic that a boss is close friends to be invited to a gathering outside of work. Especially a company the size that was depicted. In addition, who really wants there boss to see them outside of work? Maybe I am different but work is work and personal life is personal life.The chemistry between Rebecca and Tyler was off the charts. The sex scenes are very hot and spicy but there were not enough BDSM elements. I did not get the sensory deprivation tank. I know some people enjoy it but it was not believable that she adjusted so well in her first trip inside the tank.This was a very well written story. I wish there was more description of BDSM elements in their relationship. Overall, this was a wonderful story and a great addition to the story.

But when Becca's best friend Heather begs her to help prove that her parents are not enemies of the State, Becca starts to spy on her mother, suspecting her of arranging false confessions which cause innocent people to be tortured.Becca is a good character. She is honest and loyal, refusing to believe that Heather and her parents are the enemy, even when the whole school is against them. You can imagine how you would feel if your best friends parents were in this kind of trouble and you would want to help or believe it was all a mistake. Becca's snooping and her unguarded comments to her mother and friends is showing dissident traits which could see her executed if she is reported but she won't abandon her principles for an easier life, even if it is safer. I found Heather to be frustrating and a bit too changable to like but her character again is well written. When Jake comes on the scene, you are never too sure about him or his motivations which adds a bit of interest. The character that interested me the most was Becca's mother as we see different sides to her through the book that I liked. She is afraid of her daughter's behaviour and has to juggle loyalty to her with the demands of her job. She was complex and fun to read about and I think Becca's view of her mother is a bit unfair at times.The book flows nicely with no big info dumps or pointless descriptions. It is simple and effective character based storytelling which I like to see in a book. I also felt that the length of the book was just right. Adding more to it may have made the book feel too slow and having less would have resulted in missing out on the complex evolving of each character. It is good to see the author get the balance right.Plot wise, I liked the twists and turns as you are never quite sure what is going to be coming next. It gives you a real idea of what it would be like to live in this suspicious world where everyone is watching you to see that you conform to the government way of thinking. At the same time, the setting for the book is very much like the present day which lets the reader imagine that this could actually happen to them and lets them relate to the characters and their struggles. I like that the characters are flawed and make bad decisions.Overall this was a good novella/short book for YA and adult fans of dystopian books. No sexual scenes or f bombs every page.I rate this book 3 out of 5 on my star rating which is different to this site.1-didn't like2-ok3-like4-really liked5-loved</td>\n",

After the Battle of Loos he convalesced in Hampshire. A telegram summoned him to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Walter Bullivant. There is a potential danger from the Turkish Empire against the Allies. Hannay is to travel there to learn about this menace (Chapter 1). Hannay picks two aides: Sandy Arbuthnot and John S. Blenkiron (Chapter 2). In Portugal Hannay meets Peter Pienaar and takes him along (Chapter 3). They all travel into Germany and meet Ulric von Stumm (Chapter 4). The next two chapters tell of their travels in Germany. Hannay makes his escape and finds a refuge in the snowstorm (Chapter 7). He left to find a boat on the Danube (Chapter 8). Hannay finds Peter Pienaar and takes him aboard (Chapter 9). They arrive in Constantinople and find it eventful (Chapter 10). Will they be caught by their enemies (Chapter 11)?They rejoin Sandy and John. Germany wants to control the Near East (Chapter12). Hannay now poses as an American (Chapter 13). When Peter and Richard are lost at night they find a house and are directed back to the city (Chapter 14). A meeting with a Turkish officer creates a dangerous situation. Hilda von Einem visits him (Chapter 15). They all travel towards Erzerum and their motorcar breaks down (Chapter16). They steal another car to continue their journey but are arrested (Chapter 17). They are able to escape to a house outside the city (Chapter 18). Can they get the military secrets to the Russians (Chapter 19)? Chapter 20 tells how Peter crossed No-Man's Land in the night to reach the Russians. Richard and his friends try to escape to the Russian lines but are trapped on a hill (Chapter 21). Just as it seems hopeless the Russian guns and Cossack cavalry sweep away the Turkish army and German troops to provide a happy ending (Chapter 22). [Will this counteract the defeat at Gallipolli?]This was written in 1916, a bad year for the Allies. The German air force dominated the skies, until more advanced airplanes were produced for the French and British. This book can be viewed as propaganda for the Allied cause, a wish for the Russians to defeat Germany and come west. It points out the German interest in the oil-rich lands of the then Turkish Empire. Details of this story seem dated, but provides a view into the culture. John Buchan was a writer, barrister, member of Parliament, partner in a publishing house, a Church of Scotland official, and Governor-General of Canada. Few novelists have such a background.\",\n          \"While I didn't look forward to this as much as Brott's New Father, let alone Lamott's Operating Instructions, I did find parts of it really funny. And the best part is that it's got little quotes from fathers throughout, including the most anguished, troubled kinds of dilemmas, making me feel more human for my difficulty rising to the challenge sometimes. One Dad laments, \\\"It all seems like a blur. I sometimes have to fight very hard to remember what he was like even one month or one week ago. Every time I turn around, he's doing something new. I don't want to miss anything. It all makes me wonder whether I've been around enough.\\\" But then beautiful moments too, \\\"She screams with delight and babbles incessantly. Who knows what she's thinking.\\\" \\\"My son's crawling. He comes bouncing up to me, smiling his head off. It cracks me up, and I laugh hysterically. He crawls right up on my lap and nibbles my nose.\\\" I'd grade this a B.\",\n          \"I have two problems with this book. First, the narrator, Essie, makes the following disclaimer within the first few pages: \\\"You''ll say I wasn't everywhere; you'll say there's no way I can know all that I've depicted. But I stand by all the truths in this story of deception.\\\" Unfortunately, just because you acknowledge upfront the improbabilities in the narrative given the author's chosen point of view, that doesn't make the improbabilities go away. That disclaimer actually makes things worse since it calls attention to the novel's big flaw.And I'm not sure if what I'm about to say will make much sense. This isn't by any means a bad book. In fact this book is quite well written. But it is written in the identical polished prose that I come across in so much serious contemporary literature. And for me it is becoming a little boring. I suppose what I'm talking about is style, or the lack thereof.

only about half way through it.  Once I finish it I will be able to rate it again.I have finished the book and still rate it a 3.  I am not sure that the history described is accurate.  I think it just ended too abruptly.  Not very impressed.   \n",

                                                            I read the two previous trilogy concerning Thomas Covenant over 20 years ago. I was captivated by the story and characters. The world that Donaldson conceives was fresh and full of interesting creatures and beings.I was surprised to run across this book in my local library and had to read it. I was surprised how much of the preceeding stories I did not remember. A lot of the details were lost, and even with the explaination in the beginning of the book I still felt detached from the original stories.That being said, I struggled a little getting back up to speed with the chracters, and stories. I thought the story was very slow to get moving. This would have been expected if I came through it with a good feeling about the names, events, and places being refernced in the story.Luckily, the story started to clink for me and by the end of the book, I was ready for more. I am very glad (and surprised) that Donaldson decided to add another trilogy to an already classic tale.   \n",

book was a little PG rated. It was interesting but then it failed at the end. I felt like it was a children's book. Who doesn't let the people know what happen at the end. An end chapter was not stated because I guess they needed to go into the next book which is not about these characters from the start that it gives you at the end of this one. I will not read the next one becasue I don't want to know what happened to the other characters.   \n",

the priviledge to read, i thought that Miss Ashley would bring it with this series installment. I only feel this way because all of her earlier novel were off the chain. Please don't make us wait so long if the book is going to be that short.   \n",

science, but it does give it a few really interesting stories about human determination and innovation.  It's written as mostly anecdotes. The author also give some personal accounts about how this innovation bled into his training and practice as a physician.Unlike other readers, I didn't take the &#34;exploration&#34; title literally.  I think the exploration in the title is more scientific exploration of the limits of the human body.  That being said, one of the most interesting chapters was &#34;Ice,&#34; which did feature actual exploration.I thought the chapters on space were a bit thin and I, personally, could have done without them.   \n",

human garbage then I had originally thought.  Much of the claims in this book are based on fact.  Some based on circumstantial evidence.  The circumstantial evidence is very convincing.  The bottom line ....  If I was on the jury presented with information in this book, JK would be prosecuted for treason, falsifying government documents and lending aid & comfort to the enemy, just to name a few,.  And the verdict ...  GUILTY on all counts.   \n",

I bought this along with the USDA publication on home canning.  I have made a lot of jellies and jams from this book and my family loves them.  I made salsa as well, and it was very good.There are two things I didn't care for - if I was more interested in pressure canning, I would have been very disappointed.  There is very little in this book for pressure canning.  Second, I agree with other reviewers who have commented that the yields are far off.  They are not only far off - they are ridiculously far off.  I consistantly run 2-3 and sometimes 4 jars short of what the recipe claims I should have using the amount of ingredients the recipe says to use.  This is very frustrating when you the recipe says you should have 10 8 oz jars of jam and you have 5.  I understand what I did wrong with the tomato salsa recipe - strain your tomatoes AFTER you skin and quarter them, that way you have more tomatoes and probably more salsa.  I haven't figured out why the yields for the jams are so low.Many people note that they the Ball book much better than the USDA Guide because the Guide is confusing, and I can see why they would say that.  If you want REALLY EASY to understand canning recipes, look for the user manuals that came with the pressure canners back in the 1950s (when the writers thought all women were dumber than a box of hammers - you can probably find them on E-Bay).  They are very easy to follow, and some have yield charts, i.e., if you have x amount of tomatoes you will get y number of jars.  I have an Old National No. 7 canner - the forerunner of Presto - with wooden handles that is probably 60-70 years old - its manual (The Modern Guide to Home Preserving) was extremely helpful and practical.   \n",

sleep thinking it would not be very interesting.  It did keep me awake far longer than I like to admit, not so much because it was so well written, but because of the concept of this secret organization.  For a smart man, the protagonist , Mr.Rose, was pretty dumb about Kat, one of the female characters, but perhaps not so much considering he was being led by his \"little\" head. I found the story to be uneven at times with Mr. Rose being portrayed as man who loves his kids,but then the story goes on with no mention of them for a while, as if they were wall paper.  There several jarring notes in his behavior during his wife's funeral.  However, this book has monsters in it, not the supernatural kind, but human ones who unfortunately are in positions of power in government.  That is scary and the book is worth reading for that alone.   \n",

Along the way, they converse about their thoughts and feelings, reminisce about their childhoods...and then, out of nowhere, it appears that the plane has been hijacked.The players/perpetrators are Bruno, Stephen, Tom...and possibly unknown others.But this story is not at all what it seems.  In the opening paragraphs, Alice, telling this story as the first-person narrator, is at an Institute where role-playing and anti-terrorist games are the order of the day.  In a Post 9/11 world, referred to throughout this book as The Big Terrible, the anti-terrorism advocates have turned to in-fighting, dividing into the Insurgents and the Brain Worms.Thus, on Alice's flight to Melilla, there is an aura of game-playing all around the participants:  Unwilling participants who are subjected to numerous experiences which, in retrospect, may not have actually been life-threatening.Themes of rivalry (including sibling rivalry) appear throughout the story, as do themes of questioning reality and truth.  Which stories does the reader believe?  Who is doing what and why?  Did events unfold as we thought, or is it all the \"effect of living backwards\"?In a conversation between Edith and Alice, we glean a bit more about the \"experiment\":\"Talk about controlled experiment.\"\"Or maybe we're just the controlled test audience,\" Edith said.  \"In the not too distant future--depending on our valuable feedback--people will be signing up for this sort of experiment willingly.  People will pay to be hijacked, so that they can attain some transcendent, triumphant sense of resignation about their slogging, awful lives.  The motto could be:  No matter how far you go, there you are again.  You know.  Familiarity.  Remember what Dad said about familiarity.\"\"It breeds intent.\"\"He said people don't want new things.  People don't want to be surprised.\"As we ponder the themes, the ethical questions posed throughoutThe Effect of Living Backwards, we also hear the narratives of several \"passengers\" on the \"hijacked flight.\"  But their versions of truth are just that...their versions.  Or so we come to believe.But what is the true story here?  And how do Alice and Edith fare?  What will ultimately happen, and how will each of them resolve the issues?As a reader, I felt confused most of the time, intrigued some of the time, and quite happy to finally finish this \"experiment.\"  Boldly contrived and brilliantly articulated, the author shows the reader her talent for philosophical issues and experiments.  But I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who enjoys simply reading and understanding a story.  And while I admired the effort, I didn't enjoy it.  Therefore, three stars.   \n",

that translation sometimes fails.It reminds me of Thomas Moore's Lalla Rookh in that the writerwas trying to get across a culture foreign to him. He appears to be more familiarwith the traits and frailty of a Russian nobility that is more English than Russian than theIslamic Turkish tribesmen that warred with the Russian Empire just prior to the first world war.Both England and Russia where wide Empires ruled by related families.Here the Russian Prince bungles a chance to put down the rebellion cheaplyand kills the Islamic holy war prince who has sworn to help him if only he would ransom his family.Some places the story reaches high poetry levels,but like some epic poetry it tends to drag out the plot line.I think the current Russian rulers could learn from this bookand maybe our own leaders as well.Lalla Rookh An Oriental Romance   \n",

I was exposed to Peter by his writings in the Journal Parabola. I was impressed and thought I would give it a try. He is a informative writer but in this book he comes across like someone who has just had a conversion experience and makes the same point over and over. His latest book is shorter and its ties to the east are informative. In his section on sex and spiral energy, any good book on Qi Quong and the microcosmic orbit does a better job of defining what he mentions about Aphrodite. When he talks about her and Hermes as a dualist process thinker, I think of senses and thought. The book has its merits but is not read to start with.   \n",

        As a 76 year old San Franciscan I read this book to learn what happened to the California apricots and apricot orchards I remembered from my youth. It appears to be an accurate if somewhat dry recounting of their fate, written in a reportorial style consistent with the authors background as a news reporter.  There was little discussion of the human element, the sadness many of the apricot growing families must have felt as the experienced the passing of their way of life.  Also missing was an adequate discussion of how the rare micro-climate of the Santa Clara Valley allowed apricots, particularly the king of apricots the Blenheim variety, to flourish as perhaps nowhere else on earth. (The last apricot tree the author's parents planted on their property was a Blenheim). The California's Central Valley, is too hot for Blenheim's.  As someone raised on Blenheim's I find the currently available varieties almost inedible. Arguably the highest and best use of the Santa Clara Valley, but not the most profitable, was orchards.   \n",

this review.I struggle with the issues in this book. The authors talk about strength and warmth as 2 competing things everyone needs to master. The book describes what they mean by strength and warmth, then goes into detailed examples of how these work in real life. We all have elements of each. The trick is to balance them out. Too much strength without warmth can leave people behind, while too much warmth without strength can leave people vulnerable. One area the authors discuss is public speaking, and how it can be difficult to practice. One thing they didn't mention was Toastmasters, an organization that allows people to practice public speaking in a controlled environment. I realize now why this book is required reading at Harvard. They also mention the 1988 presidential debate where Michael Dukakis answered a question about his wife's rape and murder as though he'd been asked the time of day. The problem isn't reading about this, the problem is putting this into practice. That's the part I struggle with. Overall, a good book.   \n",

 Seriously, Jim Butcher is a good writer.  He isn't a great writer, he doesn't challenge your preconceptions, he doesn't force you to think deeply, but he is still a good writer.  He knows how to put together an interesting story, how to write characters that you can believe, how to manage plot (even if he uses the same pacing and elements every time, but so what, it works).But this novel clearly shows that he should have taken a year off.  I don't want to go so far as to compare him to Jordan when he was publishing dreck for money in the middle of his WoT series, but this comes very close to that travesty.  The publisher doesn't care because the books sell anyway, even to disappointed fans, because we know that the author has the potential to deliver an excellent novel.This book is so mediocre that the next novel will be a tipping point for me with regard to this author.  If he doesn't get back in the game, if he phones in another installment, then I will have to part ways with this series.  I really don't want that to happen.   \n",

on Rush, I found myself drowning in major second book LETDOWN! Both Rush and Blaire were diluted versions of the characters introduced to readers in the first book. &#8220;Never Too Far&#8221; was just a fair read for me &#8211; okay, but with lots of unresolved issues and disappointments in all areas.Rush appeared wishy-washy and his promises were empty. Blaire was immature and weak, and the entire story lacked substance in my opinion. Finally, the ending just felt rushed and disconnected. The sex was certainly hot with language to match, but even then I felt it held little meaning . . . maybe another case of less is more. The matters at hand certainly dictated the need for extra doses of serious dialogue between the couple.Abbi Glines is a fine writer whose stories are among some of my favorites. However, this one in my opinion didn&#8217;t meet her usual standard of quality. Along with my disappointment in the storyline itself, there were multiple editing errors as well, although not so glaring as to pull readers from the story.I&#8217;m hoping that redemption in the form of a third book for Rush and Blaire will find its way to readers one day soon. In my head, there were too many dangling questions left unanswered. Although we got a happily-ever-after, it was abrupt and less than fulfilling. The addition of an Epilogue could have contributed a great deal towards putting a little more spark in the otherwise bland finale.   \n",

The outcome was clear from the beginning, regardless of the evidence, or lack thereof.  The author seems to have a hard time with the English language, although he appears to be English.  I found the book hard to read and even harder to comprehend.   \n",

Carrie Montgomery is a mail order bride for Joshua Greene.  She's beautiful not sturdy and arrives with a mountain of luggage and fancy clothes plus a small dog named Choo-choo. Carrie falls in love with Joshua's two children but he can't believe she can be a good mother or a  good wife to him.  When he leaves her alone to think things over she proves to be a very smart woman who has the ability to make money, lots of it. When he returns and wants her back, she takes her time and with the arrival of her perfect brother Ring things get sticky.  Joshua has a lot to think about. Maybe he was too quick to judge his beautiful wife after all.   \n",

twentieth-century author future generations will read most. Does that sound strange? Often popular authors disappear, as they should. King at his best rises above the &quot;popular  author&quot; tag.The Green Mile suffers a bit from King's having to  include detail in one segment to remind readers of something in an earlier  segment. I hope someday King will do a rewrite to smooth out the  transitions.But he has seldom written better, and I was enormously  surprised. Yes, he can be uselessly crude, and he is here. But his  characters walk and talk and think and fear, here as almost always.I  have been disappointed in much of King in the past several years; most of  his writer-centered stuff just doesn't seem to work.The Green Mile works  on a number of levels, artistic, intellectual, and emotional. It's not his  best work, but it's very close.   \n",

                                  A cleverly contrived stor y, but, yes, contrived is the right word.  I deleted it from my kindle, as I do all books I know I will never want to read again.  Sex is a highly interesting part of life, but it's not the whole of life, and for me a fiction book must be balanced if I am to keep it or be satisfied by the reading of it. I didn't have to pay for it, but if I had, I would have asked for a refund.   \n",

Seven years later, he is in China, working as a trader in the then Chinese system in which Western traders were kept in a compound in Canton, spied on by the translators provided to them by their hosts. The translator supplied to Kyle is a young man called Jin Kang, to whom Kyle feels strangely drawn. This is explained some days later when Kyle discovers that Jin Kang is really Troth Mei-Lian Montgomery, daughter of a Scottish trader and Chinese concubine, now both dead. Troth had been taken in by the Chinese overseer of the trading system, Chenqua, who took advantage of her fluency in both languages by making her work for him in disguise.Kyle, frustrated by the restraints on Europeans, wants to explore more of China, and Troth offers to be his guide on condition that he help her get to Scotland. She agrees, and in disguise they make their way to the Temple of Hashon, becoming lovers en route. Kyle, though, makes it clear that he isn't capable of loving; Troth lies and says that she's not looking for love.On the return journey, disaster strikes: Kyle's disguise is uncovered and he is arrested and sentenced to death. Troth creeps into his cell on the pretence of administering English deathbed rites, and Kyle offers to marry her, Scottish-style, to protect her and give her a means of getting back to England.Believing that the death sentence was carried out - she heard the sound of the firing squad - Troth makes her way to England, arriving at Warfield to tell Dominic that his brother is dead. Mere weeks later, a frail but alive Kyle turns up; his captors had only played with him, pretending on several occasions to  execute him. So he and Troth are bound in a marriage of dubious legitimacy, and which neither believes the other wants.Where do they go from here?This is another Putney book I'd put off reading for some time; the Chinese element was offputting to me, since I don't care for Asian/Oriental settings and didn't like the latter two Silk books much for that reason. However, less than half of this book is actually set in China, and although Putney does her usual job of making the detail authentic (hence lots of stuff about feng shui and tai chi and chi energy and so on, most of which I skimmed rather than read), her usual skill at building a romance flows through the book.The scenes leading up to Kyle and Troth's parting and Kyle's 'death', as well as the depiction of Kyle in captivity and the mock executions, were poignant and emotional - Putney at her best. And I don't agree with those who argue that the latter part of the book is less interesting: the emotional divide and miscommunication between Kyle and Troth is also Putney at her best.

I always loved little golden books as a kid and was well aware that the story would be a condensed brief summary of the movie. It was less than that. I was pretty disappointed. It was so shortened it didn't even make sense. Sven, the reindeer, was never even mentioned. He was just in the pictures. It talks about Anna being hurt by Elsa's magic as children but that is it. She got hurt and trolls made her better. Later Elsa flees into the mountains so Anna hires a &#34;mountain man&#34; to take her to Elsa. Then Elsa cast a freezing spell on her and she needs true love's kiss. The story is over a page later. If you haven't seen the movie this will make zero sense. Since I had seen the movie I could follow. My daughter is three and just loved that it was a new way to see Anna and Elsa. Overall, not upset I made the purchase but I had higher expectations.   \n",

                   Albeit you'd never get into the book's story it'll keep you reading. But if for one person's whim can be a blackout and keep Vegas without water, I think that the State of Nevada has a very BIG problem as well as the whole country. If one simple woman thinks that she can do whatever she wants to Las Vegas's mob and get away with it... as it happened in the book... I think I better read Cinderella. It's more plausible.   \n",

It was one of those novels where I could almost hear the publisher saying, &#34;you have a deadline to meet, give us something&#34;.  I had the plot figured out long before the finish of the book.

I read some of the reviews from other Amazon Vine participants and realized that it wasn't going to be about the healing, but mostly about the abuse that she went through to get to the point where she was now.  As someone that has gone through abuse, I didn't want to read it.  I find it much harder to not have flashbacks of my life when I read through another person's tale.  I finally picked up this book on Saturday, and finished it late Saturday evening.  It was heart wrenching, and I traveled her journey with many tears.  It left me with a fairly sleepless night.  I honestly don't know how to review this more than giving a warning to someone (the 1 in 4 of us) that have been through a sexual trauma.  It's violent and graphic and regardless of where you are in your healing process, it brings up things you would rather not think about.  It is brutally honest though, and left me wishing the best for her.  I never thought that I would be rooting for a murderer, but I do hope that she continues to recover and move forward in her life.   \n",

                                      Being an avid cyclist, this is a book I should've loved, but it fell short of my expectations. For starters, there's nothing redeeming about Terry that makes me want to cheer for him and at the same time, he's not enough of a villain for me to enjoy rooting against him. In the first chapter, we learn that this attractive yet washed up 37-year-old retired cycling professional is engaged to age-appropriate Paula, sleeping with her 22-year-old daughter Susan (who is seriously dating his protegee Romain), and having a brief affair with a 19-year-old named Bobbie, whom he falls in love with after she loses her virginity to him in the backseat of his car on their first date. At the same time, neither Paula nor Romain has any clue about the infidelity and neither Terry nor Susan have any emotional complications with the affair. Then through the mixed up set of circumstances that cause Terry to end up in the Tour de France, he's just this flat, mopey, self-depricating lump of a man during the race. Without revealing the later half of the book, I'll just simply say that the characters are underdeveloped and behave in ways that I think are irrational and unexplained. Normal people have an emotional complication with having an affair with their mother's fiancee/fiancee's daughter. There's not enough of an explanation for why these people don't have a problem with it.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman   \n",

started reading it, but I'm glad I stuck with it.  EJ is a damaged woman, damaged by her mother who was too busy with her career and herself to be A mother.  Jess is a self-proclaimed angel who decides that EJ needs her specialized angel-type help.  She kidnaps EJ and takes her back to Washington for the eighth wedding of EJ's mother, and then the sparks fly!  I did not give this book 5 stars because 1) the slow start, and more importantly 2) the inserts of Lilly's (EJ's mother) writing which, although I got used to it and found it mildly interesting, was totally superfluous to the story.  Most of these ebooks could use some good editing.   \n",

Pat Conroy's writing. Still, in no way was my lack of experience with the author a bar to my enjoyment of The Death of Santini: The Story of a Father and His Son.I found this book to be very mature and very stimulating; as someone who has lost both parents, I found it very personally resonant in several key respects. However, there were some elements of Conroy's story I didn't find relatable personally, and to some extent that hindered my enjoyment of the book. It was also longer than I would have liked, but it's understandably hard to exclude things when one is dealing with such personal matters.I'd recommend this book to anyone who finds it productive to think about how our families make us who we are. I think you'll be touched by Pat Conroy's journey.Please be advised I got a free advance reader's copy through Goodreads Giveaways.   \n",

                The Ghetto fabulous theme is a little much for me. I like Kiki's writing though when she does the mystery theme and less drugs and gangs. The Yoshi Lomax stories I like better.. I still have problems with the amount of typos and grammar situations. If you like the gangster theme, this is your book.. This is Part three of the saga of drug dealers and a family trying to stay alive in a mixed up world of drugs and violence.   \n",

started out with a bang.  went downhill fast.  too convoluted with too many characters, I was always back checking trying to keep them straight.  too many descriptive passages with too much information repeated too many times that didn't have anything to do with the moving the story along. too many corny references that had me rolling my eyes.  the book was well written as to grammar and spelling, but needs an editor big time for content.   \n",

                I thought I had a good grounding in knowledge of Islam- but I was woefully under informed. An important book that any American/Westerner with children or grandchildren should read. Key takeaways are among others-Islam is both a religion and a political creed.The teachings of Islam create folks that do not think like we do - lieing and deception are honored if it furthers the goals of Islam.As Jefferson stated - our constitution in not a mutual suicide pact. The wisdom of Jefferson should not be ignored in our relationship with Islam.Absent major changes in teachings of Islam we in the west CAN NOT coexist with Islam!!   \n",

They are all coming of age. It is a summer of discovery for all of them which continues through the following decades that they remain in touch.It begins in the summer of 1974. Julie's father has just passed away, at the untimely age of 42. When she receives a scholarship to attend the camp, Spirit in the Woods, her mom decides it would be good for her to go. While there, she flourishes. When some teens get together in a camp tepee and decide to form a group that will continue to be best friends forever, into the future, she is flattered to be invited to attend; Ash and Goodman, (sister and brother), Jonah, Kathy, Ethan (an animation genius) and Julie, the newbie, round out the circle of six. When they call her Jules, she adopts the name ever after. She does comedy routines at camp and comes out of her shell. She and Ash remain best friends into adulthood and all of them remain friends, throughout the years, periodically getting together again. For the most part, they support each other and are positive influences in each other's lives.The story follows these characters from the summer of Nixon's resignation to the ten year anniversary of 9/11, when they are in their fifties. Each of their lives plays out in a different direction. They remain friends all through the ensuing years, some becoming more successful than others. Each finds their own way. Two of them marry, one is gay, one accuses another of rape, one marries someone outside the circle (Dan), and one runs off and assumes another identity in order to escape the errors of his ways. All of them are fully formed, and we live with them, their failures, successes, mistakes and conflicts as they age and face the exigencies of life.There is some crude language and also there are unnecessary sex scenes which add nothing to the story's development. From my perspective, relevant and important subjects, like intermarriage, motherhood, parental death, divorce, separation, the Aids epidemic, premarital sex, drug use, and even autism, are only casually referenced and not fully explored, while, at the same time, largely irrelevant, liberal political views run rampant, throughout the text, at every opportunity. Wealth and the evil it spawns, coupled with its alter ego, privation, a problem apparently caused by the rich, in the author's view, are mentioned as well. (The expression of the author's personal political views seems to be a very common theme running through the novels today. Authors seem to want to express their personal views and not so subtly plant references to them.)The story is sometimes repetitious as it is retold from different character's points of view as events play out.These are not perfect characters; they have flawed families and imperfect lives, with all of the sundry normal problems and not so normal ones in evidence. They have emotional trauma, mental and physical issues and even legal problems to deal with at various points of the narrative. All of the themes are knitted together in the end when the story comes full circle. There are villains and heroes.In the end, it is about life changes and changing needs as we age. It is about money and the lack of it, what money can buy and what money can destroy. It is about beauty and the lack of it. It is about the relevancy and irrelevancy of issues that sometimes seem so important at one stage of life and so trivial at another. Still, sometimes it takes almost a lifetime to work out the effects of some events in our lives, in order to move forward and live again. Life isn't fair and it isn't a fairy tale. It is not for sissies.Absent the political bias which flies off the pages expressing the author's dislike of conservative politics, it is a really \"interesting\" study of a group of teens as they grow and mature, learn how to make choices, some good and some bad, and come to realize that being \"interesting\" is in the eye of the beholder and its importance depends on circumstances and moments in time. There are many poignant moments, and moments of truth, witnessed by the reader for each of the characters. In the end, most of the characters are altruistic and soon discover that money does not always lift up the rich, but often corrupts them. It is a person's behavior, hopes and dreams that define them, not their money or position or their popularity and beauty.   \n",

                  This was told in 2person POV and it had really good flow to the story, never once getting off track or was hard to understand in fact it was a really easy story to read. The author did a unremarkable job with the writing style of this story I couldn't have been more happy to read another one from her. This was not only just a love story it was about people finding their true happiness and over-coming all their demons inside. And on that journey falling in love which was a plus if you ask me, It all worked out in the end.***I received this story for free in exchange for an honest review, see more of my review @ [...]   \n",
            "72   First I should start off by saying that I'm a pretty big Ted Dekker fan. I've been buying and reading his books for about the past 3 years now and just like most older fans, must say that I find his older faith-based, adventure-driven and emotional/relational/romantic material more inspired than his newer who-done-it fantastical supernatural material. Still, Dekker has kept up the exact same writing style throughout the years, and it's such a fantastic unique way with words and descriptions that never gets ahead of itself or tries to sound overly wordy or philosophical for its own sake... and I think it's what's kept him famous thus far, and what is also helping his fan base to grow.'Sinner' is a story based on the older 'Showdown,' and is also the last book in the Paradise Novel Series (though they say the 3 can be read in any order, which I disagree with), 'Showdown' being the first and 'Saint' being sort of a distance 2nd book that has no real alignment with this book's timeline.The characters from 'Showdown' are back as grown ups who work in the real world and have inherited supernatural powers (Billy can read minds, Darcy can influence people to do pretty much anything with the power of her voice and Johnney can have people see the true Kingdom of Heaven through one look of his blinded eyes). Yea, if this all sounds far-fetched so far, you haven't heard anything yet.The story takes place in the near future, around 2035, where the United States is basically at a sort of religious and cultural civil war where extremism in religion has reached a boiling point, Christians are looked down upon and no longer respected and mostly tolerated, and Islam has become the religion of choice in America. Without going into much detail the story is basically about Billy and Darcy being hired by the U.S. government to use their powers to influence people in the States out of all this racial and religious tension, as well as eventually influencing foreign nations to agree with the U.S. on pretty much whatever the heck it wants. Eventually they decide to enact an Amendment that prohibits religious expression and Johnney being the only devout Christian of the 3 decides to take this head on with his own small army of 3, which eventually becomes 3000 in the small town of Paradise (the town focused on in the first book 'Showdown') to fight the bill and keep religious expression alive for the sake of Christianity.Now the reason I gave this book only 3 stars is because of how much it tries to cover so many subjects at one time, and eventually using so much time to describe all the problems and tensions going on in America that Dekker must sacrifice character development in the process. Marsuvees Black (the villian from the first book, again, 'Showdown') is back but only makes brief appearances as he isn't necessarily a vital part of the story. In fact, the problem is that NOTHING is really a vital part of a story that seems to be using so many unrelated things to tell one central story, that the reader simply just stops really caring about trying to guess what will happen or feeling tense or thrilled about anything and is basically just forced to sit back and accept everything that's going on - thus leaving the reader out of any sort of relation they might have with the book. So what keeps this story afloat? Mostly Ted Dekker's writing, he's a good writer, a very good one, and the reader (most especially his fans) will keep pages turning to see when things will finally start to click together and make sense.Still, things never really do make sense as the story has a tendency to become pretty far-fetched and downright supernaturally hokey (an example being when Johnney pits himself with both Billy and Darcy in what seems to be a power-struggle STARING contest... the reader can only role their eyes at such moments. Or when a teenage rebel named Kat is at school and tries to stop a mob of extremist teenage Muslims from throwing things in the cafeteria shouting 'may the will of Allah be done!' and begins yelling how Jesus taught we are all to love each other, and said teenagers and school are never mentioned again... the reader just feels like they're getting put through filler material).Anyway, this all leads to a very cheesy and anticlimactic ending in which the battle of good and evil is ended for the moment, and at the last 2 chapters the reader already pretty much knows what's going to happen and is personally tired of all the supernatural far-fetched and forced Hocus Pocus that I would not be surprised if you just skimmed through he last 20 pages just to have the book done with. That is of course to the readers who haven't already grown impatient by the middle of the book. It almost made me laugh listening to characters continuously repeat \"kill him! kill him already!\" only to have the villain laugh and smile repeating the predictable \"you can't kill me\" type lines. Yes, this type of dialogue actually goes on for an ENTIRE CHAPTER by the end of the book. More impatient and picky readers would probably palm their faces saying 'Ted, just end it already, this is embarrassing.'And just to add another tidbit - the \"villain,\" Marsuvees Black I believe was excellent in the first book, 'Showdown,' and had a lot of depth and character, but in this one just comes off as NOTHING like his earlier self, and just another stereotypical bad guy who laughs and talks too much, but doesn't ever really do anything bad to anyone at all. You don't hate him or are afraid of him, you just wonder when he'll die already.Ted Dekker fans will most likely be disappointed by how ridiculous this book becomes at times, and though some aspects of the story become interesting (particularly Kat's character which to much dismay was pitifully WASTED, and Darcy's and Billy's exchanges with each other earlier in the book before the last quarter where everyone just seems to keep yelling all the time), but for the sake of a whole, what kills this book is both the poor pacing, disjointed scenarios, uneven storytelling, and huge sacrifice in any sort of meaningful and in-depth character development. You simply don't care very much about these people or relate to ANY of them in the least bit. Ted is a great writer and while this book wasn't terrible, it was merely OK, but in comparison with his earlier works, this just doesn't hold a candle. He needs to get back to the magic that made his earlier, more romantic books so special (Thr3e, Blessed Child, When Heaven Weeps, Showdown, Circle Trilogy) and take a break from these stretches in trying to write overly dramatic supernatural thrillers.   \n",

It is in no way a \"history of America's involvement and extrication\" in Vietnam.  What it is is a very detailed account, from Kissinger's poing of view, of the laborious negotiations with the North Vietnamese to end the Vietnam War in as honorable a way as possible.I can't say it was a bad book.  I learned a lot.  I finished it with a new appreciation for the difficult situation we were in.  It changed some of my opinions about this war and reinforced others.  But, a history of America's involvement in the war it was not.  There is anectotal information on the broader military and political context at best.  Most of the book is a meticulous account of the negotiations between Kissinger and the N. Vietnamese.   \n",

I took time out to read this small, illustrated, 51-page book.  I wasn't paying attention to anything but the price and the author when I ordered it.  I guess Jose Saramago isn't in the habit of writing short stories otherwise his publisher could just as easily have waited to include it in his next collection.The story, as I understood it, is that of a man who is searching for a new start, a new world.  He doesn't seem to express any objections to his present world, he just wants a boat so he can go find an unknown island.  If I try to tell too much more of the plot, I'll run the risk of this review being longer than the \"book\".  In the end, I understood the plot to mean that often it is the journey, rather than the destination that matters.  The determination is greater than the result.This is a nice enough story but it doesn't warrent its' own issuance.  I mean, it isn't THAT good.  I'll read more of Saramago and I'll be glad to sing his praises many times, I'm sure.  I'll just pay a little more attention to what I'm ordering in the future.   \n",

                                     This is the first book I have read by David Weber. I mean no insult to him, or his fans but I have to say there were times when I almost gave up on this book and put it on the shelf (To later list for resale on Ebay!)\"\"IT WAS A RELIEF TO FINISH IT!\"\"Too much \"POLITICS!\" I realize politics (IN MODERATION!) can make a good story,, but that is all this book is!! Maybe that is the \"POINT!\" but I had a hard time with it. If I had known this was a \"Political S.F.\" novel I would have thought twice about buying it.There were too many characters that you had to remember or you would lose track of the story. The index in the back was not much help.The story was way too long. (I think that is my main issue with it.) I will say it started off very good and there were some good moments toward the end: Some good Naval battles! Although the battle strategies did not make much sense to me. I am a landlubber though, so what do I know??After slogging through it I expected more than a \"TO BE CONTINUED\" ending.   \n",

canada, children, death, depression, disabilities, ghosts, kindle, mystery, read, strong-femThis is an adult book because of the fear it could cause in anyone but especially the young. It brought out my anxiety. Any mother would be anxious as she reads this!This is in the author's country, Canada. It isn't over emphasized but makes you want to go there. It sounds like it must be absolutely beautiful!This is about the kidnapping, torturing, dismembering and killing of children, which makes it a book I will never read again. I will forever have nightmares from this!The main character's son has a disability. He is unable to speak. Yes, you do find out why.Ghosts waft about and take over at times, be prepared. As usual, they need help.Yes, I read this with text-to-speech on my Kindle.I don't usually read mysteries, neither do I read books that will keep me awake or cause nightmares. The author leaves all the clues you need to solve the mystery. You do see it coming. Even still, as gruesome as this mystery is, you keep reading in hopes of closure for the poor mother who has been through enough.Strong fem. She just doesn't know it. She hides from her own strength in her alcohol. But when she is more sober, facing her demons, so-to-speak, you know that any person would want to escape this mess, any way they could.If I were into crime mysteries I think I would give this five stars. I prefer books like Cheryl Kaye Tardif's Whale Song.   \n",

religion, it is apparently a staple of some other belief systems. The author comes from such a tradition. Mix this broad swath with a healthy salting of \"oh isn't this cool\", and you get an idea of flavor of the book.The writing in the work is certainly readable, sometimes funny, even sometimes irreverent and Thurber-esque. And if you're looking for insight into a xtian theologian's view of other cultures it's an interesting read. But don't go to this book looking for a complete history or economic analysis of the cultures involved, and for goodness sake don't go looking here for information on any religion but the author's own (and even there, his interpretations are apparently iconoclastic).The book is comedy. Sometimes intentional, sometimes not. If that's what you were looking for, go for it. But take it with a pillar of salt.   \n",

She had an almost insatiable hunger for love combined with ridiculous taste in men. She had a short attention span. She was, as Brown points out again and again, \"a tactician,\" who often exhibited reckless disregard for the long-term consequences of her actions. All true.And yet, even after all this is disclosed, the woman we see is am ambitious, empathic woman, a mother who loves her sons, and a charismatic force of nature with a nearly undefeatable spirit. I don't know if it's Brown's writing or the power of Diana's personality that make her someone you root for, even as she races toward that sad end in Paris.My biggest quibble with the book is NOT ENOUGH PHOTOS. Over and over, Brown makes reference to this iconic photograph, or to that famous dress she wore, or how Diana's style changed to reflect her evolving personality ... and it would be nice if those photos were included in the book. I found this frustrating.   \n",

                                                      I bought this for my own personal use and have finished about one fourth of the puzzles. A neat feature is that you can tear out the puzzles to work on outside the book itself. My only disappointment with the puzzles is that many of them are more difficult than I prefer, in that there are a lot of what I consider esoteric clues and words that even well-educated persons will not know.   \n",

                After inheriting her grandmother's cottage, Chelsea decides to visit the cottage to honor her Gram's last wishes.  Thirty-three year old Chelsea is still looking for love never finding the right man's man.  Brandon has a secret guilt that he can't seem to let go.  Grandmother Brooke has lived with a deep secret and questions all her life and her family has always questioned why she never returned to her beloved cottage.  There she finds family secrets and a handsome doctor, Brandon, who has his own mysterious pass. This laid-back read switches from Chelsea's contemporary story to Brooke's (Gram) love story which took place during WWII.While the secrets aren't stunning or surprising, they are revealed in a way that maintains interest throughout the book.  This book reminds me a bit of the The Violets of March by Sarah Jio but the feel of the book and the writing style is different.  While I liked the book and the characters, I didn't love them.  I thought the relationship between Chelsea and Brandon was rushed and not as believable while I loved the relationship of Bill, Brooke, and Greg.  I enjoyed the moments in the past more than the present.  However, I think I liked the unwinding of the story most of all.   \n",

The writing's fairly taut and fresh and the plot cracks along but the modern tone, though justified by the surprise plot twist at the end, seems remarkably out of place. We get a fairly good tour of the English (and Welsh) countryside as our reluctant viking protagonist learns to raid and kill in the best tradition of his forebears, gets lost from his raiding party and hooks up with a lovely, if mysterious, female companion and finally finds his shipmates again, only to get swept overboard, with the girl, and end up in the monastery at Lindisfarne just prior to the historical raid on that site which kicked off the full scale viking age in England -- which was to trouble the natives there for the next hundred years or so. We get an oddly bracing picture of these vikings too, professional warriors that they were, as they ready themselves for each upcoming encounter (not unlike the limbering-up exercises of a modern football team about to meet the \"other side\" out on the gridiron in a friendly match) -- you almost have to believe in the realism of it all, despite the warm fuzzy feeling you get once you've really gotten to know these boys. Even Thorfinn Skullsplitter seems like the kind of guy you wouldn't mind splitting a beer with -- assuming that's all he's in the mood for cleaving. But the dragon stuff seems rather forced and out of place. And the end, clever as it is, only adds to the sense that this book and this author didn't quite know where they wanted to go with the story. The protagonist's \"voice\" lapses into a rather sophomoric, counter-cultural patois as the tale winds down, which is both jarring and debilitating to the rest of the tale. And, though it's justified by the ending, the ending itself is discordant with what went before. You may guess it from the way the story moves, but I doubt you'll figure out the locale.The surprise ending in this one seems to have pleased many readers but I found it a bit off-putting, myself, turning what had seemed to me to be a good, and nicely paced, historical yarn into something a bit too self-concious and cute. I prefer my viking tales with a larger dash of authenticity so the abrupt plot twist which brings this one to a close, left me a bit cold.But it's nicely written and holds the reader to the end.SWM   \n",

Ms. Saintcrow, and liked them both--particularly the Dante Valentine books.  This new endeavor, \"The Demon's Librarian\" is a good read as well, but you should note it is a paranormal romance,and thus the plot focus is on the romance first, paranormal fantasy second.I enjoyed the story, the worldbuilding and characterizations were good, the writing overall well done; but because this was a romance the book was a bit lightweight for me.  But don't let me discourage you from reading \"The Demon's Librarian;\" any complaints aside, I'll be buying the sequel.  (And as a side note:  I know it's not the author's fault, but that cover is ugly!)   \n",

Jackson to succeed. He has done so much for his country that he should have every success he dreams of. I hope and believe he will continue to improve.As others have pointed out, the editing is poor and the author clearly needs to learn better punctuation and grammer, and he should take the time to check the meanings of words. He all too often either misuses words or chooses terms that are just not quite apt.The protagonist has every reason to be bitter, but the effects of his treatment does not seem to have affected him permanently in any consequential way. He also is amazingly successful given his naivete and poor judgment. He spills crucial secrets about himself with the slightest nudge. Young people sometimes do such stupid things, but in real life such carelessness brings failures, betrayals, and dissappointments. This guy, though, rarely stubs his toes in such situations. Likewise, going to every greater success very quickly can be exhilarating if handled well, but in this case it is perilously close to boring at timesOn the other hand, the author has imagination and has created an interesting and not terribly derivative world. If he continually improves his writing and plot development, that could bring him great success.   \n",

book/series around for a while now, often popping up in Amazon's &#34;customers' who bought this book also bought&#34; recommendations. I finally succumbed and bought Spider's Bite. Unfortunately, I was right. It wasn't for me.Strong characters, lots of action, impressive world building and some sexual tension - but I couldn't get past the level of violence.It's funny. GA Aiken's Dragon series is violent, but I adjusted to that. Perhaps because it's tempered with humour and love and family.Spider's Bite was just too strong for me. But if you're not freaked by a bit of blood and revenge, I can see why this series has its committed fans.   \n",

                                         This is a decent beginner's book to chakras, meditation and balancing energy.  It's not very in depth, but it will get you started.  There are better guides out there for this subject in my opinion.   \n",

Seems like old plots from the previous Malory's were reused.  If this had been the first Malory novel I had read then it would have also been the last.  JL seems to be propping the last 2 Malory stories up with the more lovable Malory characters.  I think there would have been a better way to go with Jeremy's story; as with Derek's story, James and Tony seemed to be the hero's.  I would like to see a book for Drew Anderson but not if he can't stand on his own. I was so hoping Jeremy's story would come about from a bet with his cousin Amy.  Jeremy used to be a lovable rake; in this book he didn't seem like a rake at all. Kinda boring.  Wasn't really thrilled with Danny either.   \n",

              First off, Herbert has done an incredible job building and detailing his world of Arrakis.  There is a clearly defined mythology, religion, political system, philosophy and ecology in this world.  Despite all the introduced terminology in the book, I feel it is easy enough for the reader to pick up and understand these new terms.Having said that, I did not find the main characters, or many of the other characters, interesting.  Paul and Jessica are unappealing characters because of their seeming penchant for all of their actions to be based on political reasons.  While there is a need for it at times, it seems like all of their actions are made for manuvering their survival on Arrakis.  I feel that the better characters are Gurney Halleck and Dr. Yueh.  Both men have detailed backstories that fully explain their motivations in the actions they take, which are made for a myriad of reasons, not just political.I felt that the book would have benefitted from more of a balance between action and political intrigue.  The action sequences that did take place were ok, and would have kept my interest more.I realize that I am in the minority with my opinion of Dune.  I give Herbert a lot of credit for creating a fully imagined and detailed world, and this novel was no doubt groundbreaking at the time of publication.  For me, the book would have benefitted more if the same detail had been paid to his characterizations.   \n",

Add to this a narrator whose first-person, documental prose discusses everything from his father being transferred to a labor camp to, at the end of the novel, his blas&eacute; reaction to his father's death in the camps.  Thinking back on it, this was one of the central problems for me: his reactions, even to the most horrific experiences (like finding out that there were crematoria in the camps), was unconvincingly cool and aloof.In one of the last sentences of \"Fateless,\" Gyorgy says \"Everybody will ask me about the deprivations, the `terror of the camps,' but for me, the happiness there will always be the most memorable experience, perhaps.  Yes, that's what I'll tell them the next time they ask me: about the happiness in those camps.\"  I wonder what survivors today would say about that sentence; I do not deny that some might find it interesting, but I would be curious about the average reaction that a Holocaust survivor had to it.  What I find most disconcerting about this is not that he could have found happiness in the camps.  We are forced to find our own ways to survive psychologically, after all.  But nothing in the book leading up to that sentence would have led the reader to believe that it was true.  As a result, the whole thing ended up feeling false, more like a series of diary entries than a coherent, lucid account of concentration camp life.  I use the term \"diary entries\" here because, while so many people claim that this is biographical or semi-biographical novel, Kertesz has purportedly denied this is true.But I should note some important qualifications.  I didn't read the novel in Hungarian, I may have been in a particularly non-receptive mood while reading it, et cetera.  Another reviewer wrote, \"In the end I remained as detached and as unengaged as Gyorgy himself.\"  I agree.  And because of that, I'm afraid it will not stick with me in the same way, say, that Primo Levi's \"The Periodic Table\" has.I was glad this was not, as so much popular Holocaust fiction is, a simplistic story of \"good triumphing over evil.\"  Kertesz never turns the events in the camps into some gratuitous pornography of atrocity after atrocity, leaving us to sanctimoniously shake our heads in disapproval.  How true is it?  In some ways, I hope I will never find out.  But the sincerity of his literary effort and vision are not something I cannot call into question.   \n",

I will give the author credit for offering  a foreword that goes into the geology and palentology of his scenario. I won't nitpick any further on this: It's the author's setting, it's a given, and what the reader wants is to see is how well he uses it.As prose, this book is a step back from Alten's The Loch, which I thought a very good novel. Hell's Aquarium uses a breathless style with lots of dashes and exclamation points in the narrative.  Alten's work in The Loch showed he didn't need that sort of gimmickry, and I'm not sure why he uses it here.Most of the characters are three-dimensional: Alten has improved on this from book to book. His strength, as always, is fast-moving action, and there are some real page-turner moments. Alten has a knack for popular culture: I loved the Internet contest that resulted in naming two captive Megalodons Mary-Kate and Ashley. A final thing I liked was the ending, not for its plausibility, but for springing a genuine surprise about who lives and who dies.Alten likes to pile on the creatures and maximize their sizes.  This is ok: it's fiction, and if Peter Benchley can use a 100-foot squid, Alten can use a 122-foot Liopleurodon. (I liked his 25-foot evolved form of the vampire squid Vampyroteuthis infernalis - that would be scary as hell in real life.) It's not clear how creatures from eras over 200 million years apart could have ended up in this habitat, although I'll buy anything that allows bringing my favorite predator Dunkleosteus on stage.  Alten takes pains to emphasize there's a complete food web in the \"aquarium,\" although, like Peter Jackson's take on Skull Island, it still seems too slanted toward megapredators. All the big reptiles are here (evolved gills and all), along with a squadron of sharks and even a monster turtle. This makes for an exciting series of beast-on-beast conflicts as the humans bascially try to avoid becoming snacks. Alten has some good moments of description concerning the creatures and their dark, cold, deep habitat.As a cryptozoological researcher, I kept thinking of Bernard Heuvelmans' dissection of sea-serpent reports into as many as nine species. Alten's beasts could cover all those categories and then some. There hasn't really been a mention of cryptozoology in the Meg series since the first book, and it would have been fun to throw in a prominent cryptozoologist to react to the fact that, while cryptozoology has been chasing a new shark here and a giant eel there, there's been a horde of spectacular creatures unguessed-at.The level of cooperation and intelligence shown by some of Alten's sharks goes beyond what we know of real sharks, although the Megs, at least, have had 60 million years to evolve this way, so mark that as a permissible fiction-author liberty. At the end, two escaped Megs are setting themselves up as new apex predators of their own patch of the coastal Pacific, violently displacing the orcas which have been used to being on top. I'll be curious to see whether Alten follows that up in the next sequel. There's some interesting science he could go into, if he so chooses, about what would happen in an event like that.I thought the third Meg novel was a little better written than this one.  I thought The Loch was better still, and it puzzles me that Alten has slipped back from the quality (in this reader's opinion, of course) of his best novel.Overall, Hell's Aquarium is what it's supposed to be, which is fun. It's like going to a Transformers film. You wonder about plot holes and implausible escapes, but you came to see the robots in action. You pick up an Alten novel to see the creatures in action. Hell's Aquarium gives you what you pay for.   \n",

Plus it started off kind of slow.. Not to mention there was a lot of internal dialogue going on. But let me just say by the time i got to the last page i gave myself a thunk in the head for not reading it when i first got it.Basically yes. Lots of internal stuff. i tend to skim those parts in every book anyways.. but otherwise. i cant wait for the next one. i made up theories about the series.. i'm just waiting for them to be confirmed now.   \n",

find this book to offer any startling revelations.  I had to read it for a seminar, and found myself skimming the later sections of the book.  It was well written and easy to read.  He just could have said what he had to say in fewer pages.   \n",

  This book is okay. It isn't fantastic, but it's not bad, either. On the positive side, I really liked the message and the story. Shelby is a sweet girl and is a great example of paying it forward. I like the way she worked hard all summer to create something that would benefit other people. I also really liked Mr. T. He is a wonderful, grandfatherly figure that takes the initiative to spend quality time with a child.On the downside, I'm not sure this would appeal to the target age group. The writing was alright, but it was a little too straight forward. The book also had a lot of filler - passages that didn't really seem to have any purpose. For example, there is a lot of discussion of measurements and if they should stain or paint the boards they were working on. The illustrations were just okay for me. Didn't love them, didn't hate them.Overall, this is a sweet book about an elderly man and a young girl spending their summer making other people's lives better. I think adults will enjoy it more than kids, but you never know.   \n",

There is no answer to questions such as whether a terrorist can legitimately be tortured to reveal the location of a bomb, or whether an innocent life can be sacrificed to save many lives. What the book does have, however,  is Mill's revised version of utilitarianism that is important because it plays a major role in his other works such as \"Liberty\".Much of the book explains and agrees with Bentham's version of utilitarianism that has no place for rights and replaces the concept of good/evil with pleasure/pain, but Mill's version of utilitarianism has an important difference - the claim that some pleasures are intrinsically superior to others, and if this is so then utilitarianism should strive to enable everybody to enjoy the superior pleasures.Mill defines utilitarianism as the \"Greatest Happiness Principle\" that judges \"actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\"  In this he is following Bentham's definition, but Bentham had devised a \"felicific calculus\" to determine the amount of pleasure (and hence moral worth) arising from any given action. It depended on things such as the intensity, duration and number of people affected. Bentham did not believe that one pleasure is in any way better than another except in terms of quantity. He wrote, for example, that \"Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry.\"Mill disagrees with this relativism, arguing that \"some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.\" In other words, quality is more important than quantity. Here we see the elitism that we find in all Mill's works. He asks how one can judge between the pleasure derived by two people from different actions and he answers that the person of what he calls \"higher faculties\" is the one to judge, if he can understand the relative merits of both actions and the other person cannot. Translating to a modern context we might ask why Mill would believe a Shakespeare play to be \"better\" than a TV reality show. Mill would claim that the person of \"higher faculties\" who fully appreciated Shakespeare would be able to see the merits of both and hence judge, whilst the other person could only appreciate the reality show and be unable to judge the relative merits of both.Mill seems to ditch the pleasure principle almost entirely at one point when suggesting that those with higher faculties are likely to find it more difficult to be happy because they realize the world is imperfect. But that realization does not make them envy the happiness of those with lower capabilities. In Mill's famous words\"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.\"It follows for Mill that if some pleasures are superior to others then it would be a good thing if more people could enjoy the higher pleasures. Mill believes that utilitarianism should aim at the general advancement of mankind for it can \"only attain its end by the general cultivation of nobleness of character.\"This edition of \"Utilitarianism\" also contains Mill's 1868 speech on capital punishment delivered to the English Parliament. Mill supports the use of capital punishment for murder and has two main arguments:1. Capital punishment is much more effective as a deterrent than any alternative.2. Capital punishment is more humane than incarceration for life, which Mill assumes to be the only alternative to the death penalty. He writes: \"What comparison can there really be, in point of severity, between consigning a man to the short pang of a rapid death, and immuring him in a living tomb, there to linger out what may be a long life in the hardest and most monotonous toil, without any of its alleviations.\"Nobody of Mill's generation contemplated the modern situation where many murderers in Britain as in most other   \n",

                              I am a huge fan of apocalyptic fiction and as a Brit living in the states I have a particular fondness for these stories when they are set in the UK.The premise is good, Britain is flooded and once the floodwaters subside the survivors have to get down to the business of surviving and in true apocalyptic fashion they decide to go on  a quest to find safety.Unfortunately Morris doesnt seem to really want to write a disaster novel, there is no real explanation as to what caused the flood and the emerging enemy is never really explained.  Are they aliens or a form of creature from the depths of the sea which is now evolving.I really wanted to like this book but never getting any bigger picture of the disaster or even some sort of explanation really did leave me cold.The characters are an interesting bunch and Morris actually writes them intelligently and quite believably. The addition of a disabled character posed some unique problems for the survivors which I enjoyed.Maybe if Morris writes a sequel with some answers I may find myself appreciating this book more but as it stands at the moment I ultimately found myself cheated that the author did not give any form of conclusion but left you hanging.   \n",

                                                 I remember reading Shirley Jackson's story The Lottery in school.  I was a book of her stories which includes The Lottery.  Unfortunately, I didn't care for too many of the stories in the book.  Every story I read was depressing and the characters were hopeless, helpless, and after reading a few, I had my fill.  I did enjoy reading The Lottery again, but that was the only story I enjoyed.   \n",

and I thoughtThe Da Vinci Codewas a fantastic read...fun, great twists, cool story, nice little historical mystery deal. Great. Fast-paced with lots of cliff-hangers, which I totally dig. Lost Symbol has plenty of cliff-hangers, but this time the pay-off just isn't there. The bad guy kinda sucks, he's weird and that's good, but his big motivation is telegraphed way early on so his big reveal was kinda spoiled. Also, the shocking revelation that would overturn the entire country? Really? That's all you could come up with? Bleh. Then the BIG final mystery...I really felt cheated. That's it?! That's all there is? Wow, what an amazing let down. And the epilogue was just a waste of 30 pages. Everything about the book prior to that was good. But the ending was so deflating and uninteresting that it demolished everything that came before it. What a shame...I still like Dan Brown and Robert Langdon, but I hope they didn't just jump the shark on this one. Solving the codes and stuff on the cover was more fun than reading the ending of this book. Maybe if you only read the first 350 pages and let the ending be a mystery...that might be the best way to enjoy this one. One of the worst endings to a fun book that I have read in a long time.   \n",

I was most excited to read Sienna Mynx's books because I find her work very enjoyable but I could not stand the heroine in the book, Kyra.  She really, really, really annoyed me.  I found her to be immature and I could not imagine why a man like Renaldo who was very grounded would have found an instant connection to her besides sex.  Hopefully, Kyra grows up in the next book.  Pepper Pace's book was interesting to me and I enjoyed it.  I will say that her work is normally not something that I buy because her style is different than what I normally enjoy (this is my opinion) but I will buy the sequel to her book.  Latrivia Nelson's book was also enjoyable and I liked the strong and quiet hero.  I have been a fan of Latrivia since reading Ivy's Twisted Vine but I hope she comes up with the sequel in a reasonable amount of time and does not overpromise when the sequel will come out to her fans.  Aliya Burke's book was pretty interesting as well.  I struggled with Affrica's brogue but I appreciate a different kinda heroine.  I also thought Reeve was a jerk but he had enough redeeming qualities about him that I rooted for him.  Tiana Laveen is a gifted writer and I enjoyed reading about Julian in Tattooed Moon but I found him to be a little too preachy which is common with some of the male characters in her others books.  The other author's books were ok, not bad but not super exciting either.  I will say that the amount of material that we received for such a reasonable price is absolutely outstanding and I am encouraged by the strong amount of fan support these ladies have going for them.  Again, this is my opinion and I hope all of these authors succeed.   \n",

                                                 What was most fascinating about this book was that it started off almost in the middle of a story, as if you turned on the TV and watched a flick with out seeing the beginning. And then the book ended the same way, as if you turned the movie off with out seeing the conclusion. If I did not know that there were several other books in the series, I think that I would have been reviewing Freedom's Landing in a better light. I say this because this story felt more like a dream that you look back upon after waking. The beginning might be hazy and the end is where the alarm clock took over.This is a pretty crazy tale; aliens invade earth and round up slaves from major cities. They use whips to force people into the ships as if they were cattle. If you read the book think about how strange some aspects of her story are. The dialogue is pretty bad, but then again, I think she was aiming towards a younger audience than myself, so I forgive her for that.If you're looking for a good female science fiction writer and were seeing if McCaffrey was a starting point on that endeavor, pass her by for the time being. Instead concentrate on Connie Willis and her book 'To say nothing of the dog.'   \n",

only about half way through it.  Once I finish it I will be able to rate it again.I have finished the book and still rate it a 3.  I am not sure that the history described is accurate.  I think it just ended too abruptly.  Not very impressed.   \n",

                                                              I read the two previous trilogy concerning Thomas Covenant over 20 years ago. I was captivated by the story and characters. The world that Donaldson conceives was fresh and full of interesting creatures and beings.I was surprised to run across this book in my local library and had to read it. I was surprised how much of the preceeding stories I did not remember. A lot of the details were lost, and even with the explaination in the beginning of the book I still felt detached from the original stories.That being said, I struggled a little getting back up to speed with the chracters, and stories. I thought the story was very slow to get moving. This would have been expected if I came through it with a good feeling about the names, events, and places being refernced in the story.Luckily, the story started to clink for me and by the end of the book, I was ready for more. I am very glad (and surprised) that Donaldson decided to add another trilogy to an already classic tale.   \n",

book was a little PG rated. It was interesting but then it failed at the end. I felt like it was a children's book. Who doesn't let the people know what happen at the end. An end chapter was not stated because I guess they needed to go into the next book which is not about these characters from the start that it gives you at the end of this one. I will not read the next one becasue I don't want to know what happened to the other characters.   \n",

the priviledge to read, i thought that Miss Ashley would bring it with this series installment. I only feel this way because all of her earlier novel were off the chain. Please don't make us wait so long if the book is going to be that short.   \n",

science, but it does give it a few really interesting stories about human determination and innovation.  It's written as mostly anecdotes. The author also give some personal accounts about how this innovation bled into his training and practice as a physician.Unlike other readers, I didn't take the &#34;exploration&#34; title literally.  I think the exploration in the title is more scientific exploration of the limits of the human body.  That being said, one of the most interesting chapters was &#34;Ice,&#34; which did feature actual exploration.I thought the chapters on space were a bit thin and I, personally, could have done without them.   \n",

human garbage then I had originally thought.  Much of the claims in this book are based on fact.  Some based on circumstantial evidence.  The circumstantial evidence is very convincing.  The bottom line ....  If I was on the jury presented with information in this book, JK would be prosecuted for treason, falsifying government documents and lending aid & comfort to the enemy, just to name a few,.  And the verdict ...  GUILTY on all counts.   \n",

I bought this along with the USDA publication on home canning.  I have made a lot of jellies and jams from this book and my family loves them.  I made salsa as well, and it was very good.There are two things I didn't care for - if I was more interested in pressure canning, I would have been very disappointed.  There is very little in this book for pressure canning.  Second, I agree with other reviewers who have commented that the yields are far off.  They are not only far off - they are ridiculously far off.  I consistantly run 2-3 and sometimes 4 jars short of what the recipe claims I should have using the amount of ingredients the recipe says to use.  This is very frustrating when you the recipe says you should have 10 8 oz jars of jam and you have 5.  I understand what I did wrong with the tomato salsa recipe - strain your tomatoes AFTER you skin and quarter them, that way you have more tomatoes and probably more salsa.  I haven't figured out why the yields for the jams are so low.Many people note that they the Ball book much better than the USDA Guide because the Guide is confusing, and I can see why they would say that.  If you want REALLY EASY to understand canning recipes, look for the user manuals that came with the pressure canners back in the 1950s (when the writers thought all women were dumber than a box of hammers - you can probably find them on E-Bay).  They are very easy to follow, and some have yield charts, i.e., if you have x amount of tomatoes you will get y number of jars.  I have an Old National No. 7 canner - the forerunner of Presto - with wooden handles that is probably 60-70 years old - its manual (The Modern Guide to Home Preserving) was extremely helpful and practical.   \n",

to sleep thinking it would not be very interesting.  It did keep me awake far longer than I like to admit, not so much because it was so well written, but because of the concept of this secret organization.  For a smart man, the protagonist , Mr.Rose, was pretty dumb about Kat, one of the female characters, but perhaps not so much considering he was being led by his \"little\" head. I found the story to be uneven at times with Mr. Rose being portrayed as man who loves his kids,but then the story goes on with no mention of them for a while, as if they were wall paper.  There several jarring notes in his behavior during his wife's funeral.  However, this book has monsters in it, not the supernatural kind, but human ones who unfortunately are in positions of power in government.  That is scary and the book is worth reading for that alone.   \n",

Along the way, they converse about their thoughts and feelings, reminisce about their childhoods...and then, out of nowhere, it appears that the plane has been hijacked.The players/perpetrators are Bruno, Stephen, Tom...and possibly unknown others.But this story is not at all what it seems.  In the opening paragraphs, Alice, telling this story as the first-person narrator, is at an Institute where role-playing and anti-terrorist games are the order of the day.  In a Post 9/11 world, referred to throughout this book as The Big Terrible, the anti-terrorism advocates have turned to in-fighting, dividing into the Insurgents and the Brain Worms.Thus, on Alice's flight to Melilla, there is an aura of game-playing all around the participants:  Unwilling participants who are subjected to numerous experiences which, in retrospect, may not have actually been life-threatening.Themes of rivalry (including sibling rivalry) appear throughout the story, as do themes of questioning reality and truth.  Which stories does the reader believe?  Who is doing what and why?  Did events unfold as we thought, or is it all the \"effect of living backwards\"?In a conversation between Edith and Alice, we glean a bit more about the \"experiment\":\"Talk about controlled experiment.\"\"Or maybe we're just the controlled test audience,\" Edith said.  \"In the not too distant future--depending on our valuable feedback--people will be signing up for this sort of experiment willingly.  People will pay to be hijacked, so that they can attain some transcendent, triumphant sense of resignation about their slogging, awful lives.  The motto could be:  No matter how far you go, there you are again.  You know.  Familiarity.  Remember what Dad said about familiarity.\"\"It breeds intent.\"\"He said people don't want new things.  People don't want to be surprised.\"As we ponder the themes, the ethical questions posed throughoutThe Effect of Living Backwards, we also hear the narratives of several \"passengers\" on the \"hijacked flight.\"  But their versions of truth are just that...their versions.  Or so we come to believe.But what is the true story here?  And how do Alice and Edith fare?  What will ultimately happen, and how will each of them resolve the issues?As a reader, I felt confused most of the time, intrigued some of the time, and quite happy to finally finish this \"experiment.\"  Boldly contrived and brilliantly articulated, the author shows the reader her talent for philosophical issues and experiments.  But I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who enjoys simply reading and understanding a story.  And while I admired the effort, I didn't enjoy it.  Therefore, three stars.   \n",

poetry that translation sometimes fails.It reminds me of Thomas Moore's Lalla Rookh in that the writerwas trying to get across a culture foreign to him. He appears to be more familiarwith the traits and frailty of a Russian nobility that is more English than Russian than theIslamic Turkish tribesmen that warred with the Russian Empire just prior to the first world war.Both England and Russia where wide Empires ruled by related families.Here the Russian Prince bungles a chance to put down the rebellion cheaplyand kills the Islamic holy war prince who has sworn to help him if only he would ransom his family.Some places the story reaches high poetry levels,but like some epic poetry it tends to drag out the plot line.I think the current Russian rulers could learn from this bookand maybe our own leaders as well.Lalla Rookh An Oriental Romance   \n",

I was exposed to Peter by his writings in the Journal Parabola. I was impressed and thought I would give it a try. He is a informative writer but in this book he comes across like someone who has just had a conversion experience and makes the same point over and over. His latest book is shorter and its ties to the east are informative. In his section on sex and spiral energy, any good book on Qi Quong and the microcosmic orbit does a better job of defining what he mentions about Aphrodite. When he talks about her and Hermes as a dualist process thinker, I think of senses and thought. The book has its merits but is not read to start with.   \n",

          As a 76 year old San Franciscan I read this book to learn what happened to the California apricots and apricot orchards I remembered from my youth. It appears to be an accurate if somewhat dry recounting of their fate, written in a reportorial style consistent with the authors background as a news reporter.  There was little discussion of the human element, the sadness many of the apricot growing families must have felt as the experienced the passing of their way of life.  Also missing was an adequate discussion of how the rare micro-climate of the Santa Clara Valley allowed apricots, particularly the king of apricots the Blenheim variety, to flourish as perhaps nowhere else on earth. (The last apricot tree the author's parents planted on their property was a Blenheim). The California's Central Valley, is too hot for Blenheim's.  As someone raised on Blenheim's I find the currently available varieties almost inedible. Arguably the highest and best use of the Santa Clara Valley, but not the most profitable, was orchards.   \n",

this review.I struggle with the issues in this book. The authors talk about strength and warmth as 2 competing things everyone needs to master. The book describes what they mean by strength and warmth, then goes into detailed examples of how these work in real life. We all have elements of each. The trick is to balance them out. Too much strength without warmth can leave people behind, while too much warmth without strength can leave people vulnerable. One area the authors discuss is public speaking, and how it can be difficult to practice. One thing they didn't mention was Toastmasters, an organization that allows people to practice public speaking in a controlled environment. I realize now why this book is required reading at Harvard. They also mention the 1988 presidential debate where Michael Dukakis answered a question about his wife's rape and murder as though he'd been asked the time of day. The problem isn't reading about this, the problem is putting this into practice. That's the part I struggle with. Overall, a good book.   \n",

   Seriously, Jim Butcher is a good writer.  He isn't a great writer, he doesn't challenge your preconceptions, he doesn't force you to think deeply, but he is still a good writer.  He knows how to put together an interesting story, how to write characters that you can believe, how to manage plot (even if he uses the same pacing and elements every time, but so what, it works).But this novel clearly shows that he should have taken a year off.  I don't want to go so far as to compare him to Jordan when he was publishing dreck for money in the middle of his WoT series, but this comes very close to that travesty.  The publisher doesn't care because the books sell anyway, even to disappointed fans, because we know that the author has the potential to deliver an excellent novel.This book is so mediocre that the next novel will be a tipping point for me with regard to this author.  If he doesn't get back in the game, if he phones in another installment, then I will have to part ways with this series.  I really don't want that to happen.   \n",

on Rush, I found myself drowning in major second book LETDOWN! Both Rush and Blaire were diluted versions of the characters introduced to readers in the first book. &#8220;Never Too Far&#8221; was just a fair read for me &#8211; okay, but with lots of unresolved issues and disappointments in all areas.Rush appeared wishy-washy and his promises were empty. Blaire was immature and weak, and the entire story lacked substance in my opinion. Finally, the ending just felt rushed and disconnected. The sex was certainly hot with language to match, but even then I felt it held little meaning . . . maybe another case of less is more. The matters at hand certainly dictated the need for extra doses of serious dialogue between the couple.Abbi Glines is a fine writer whose stories are among some of my favorites. However, this one in my opinion didn&#8217;t meet her usual standard of quality. Along with my disappointment in the storyline itself, there were multiple editing errors as well, although not so glaring as to pull readers from the story.I&#8217;m hoping that redemption in the form of a third book for Rush and Blaire will find its way to readers one day soon. In my head, there were too many dangling questions left unanswered. Although we got a happily-ever-after, it was abrupt and less than fulfilling. The addition of an Epilogue could have contributed a great deal towards putting a little more spark in the otherwise bland finale.   \n",

The outcome was clear from the beginning, regardless of the evidence, or lack thereof.  The author seems to have a hard time with the English language, although he appears to be English.  I found the book hard to read and even harder to comprehend.   \n",

Carrie Montgomery is a mail order bride for Joshua Greene.  She's beautiful not sturdy and arrives with a mountain of luggage and fancy clothes plus a small dog named Choo-choo. Carrie falls in love with Joshua's two children but he can't believe she can be a good mother or a  good wife to him.  When he leaves her alone to think things over she proves to be a very smart woman who has the ability to make money, lots of it. When he returns and wants her back, she takes her time and with the arrival of her perfect brother Ring things get sticky.  Joshua has a lot to think about. Maybe he was too quick to judge his beautiful wife after all.   \n",

twentieth-century author future generations will read most. Does that sound strange? Often popular authors disappear, as they should. King at his best rises above the &quot;popular  author&quot; tag.The Green Mile suffers a bit from King's having to  include detail in one segment to remind readers of something in an earlier  segment. I hope someday King will do a rewrite to smooth out the  transitions.But he has seldom written better, and I was enormously  surprised. Yes, he can be uselessly crude, and he is here. But his  characters walk and talk and think and fear, here as almost always.I  have been disappointed in much of King in the past several years; most of  his writer-centered stuff just doesn't seem to work.The Green Mile works  on a number of levels, artistic, intellectual, and emotional. It's not his  best work, but it's very close.   \n",

                                    A cleverly contrived stor y, but, yes, contrived is the right word.  I deleted it from my kindle, as I do all books I know I will never want to read again.  Sex is a highly interesting part of life, but it's not the whole of life, and for me a fiction book must be balanced if I am to keep it or be satisfied by the reading of it. I didn't have to pay for it, but if I had, I would have asked for a refund.   \n",

Seven years later, he is in China, working as a trader in the then Chinese system in which Western traders were kept in a compound in Canton, spied on by the translators provided to them by their hosts. The translator supplied to Kyle is a young man called Jin Kang, to whom Kyle feels strangely drawn. This is explained some days later when Kyle discovers that Jin Kang is really Troth Mei-Lian Montgomery, daughter of a Scottish trader and Chinese concubine, now both dead. Troth had been taken in by the Chinese overseer of the trading system, Chenqua, who took advantage of her fluency in both languages by making her work for him in disguise.Kyle, frustrated by the restraints on Europeans, wants to explore more of China, and Troth offers to be his guide on condition that he help her get to Scotland. She agrees, and in disguise they make their way to the Temple of Hashon, becoming lovers en route. Kyle, though, makes it clear that he isn't capable of loving; Troth lies and says that she's not looking for love.On the return journey, disaster strikes: Kyle's disguise is uncovered and he is arrested and sentenced to death. Troth creeps into his cell on the pretence of administering English deathbed rites, and Kyle offers to marry her, Scottish-style, to protect her and give her a means of getting back to England.Believing that the death sentence was carried out - she heard the sound of the firing squad - Troth makes her way to England, arriving at Warfield to tell Dominic that his brother is dead. Mere weeks later, a frail but alive Kyle turns up; his captors had only played with him, pretending on several occasions to  execute him. So he and Troth are bound in a marriage of dubious legitimacy, and which neither believes the other wants.Where do they go from here?This is another Putney book I'd put off reading for some time; the Chinese element was offputting to me, since I don't care for Asian/Oriental settings and didn't like the latter two Silk books much for that reason. However, less than half of this book is actually set in China, and although Putney does her usual job of making the detail authentic (hence lots of stuff about feng shui and tai chi and chi energy and so on, most of which I skimmed rather than read), her usual skill at building a romance flows through the book.The scenes leading up to Kyle and Troth's parting and Kyle's 'death', as well as the depiction of Kyle in captivity and the mock executions, were poignant and emotional - Putney at her best. And I don't agree with those who argue that the latter part of the book is less interesting: the emotional divide and miscommunication between Kyle and Troth is also Putney at her best.

I always loved little golden books as a kid and was well aware that the story would be a condensed brief summary of the movie. It was less than that. I was pretty disappointed. It was so shortened it didn't even make sense. Sven, the reindeer, was never even mentioned. He was just in the pictures. It talks about Anna being hurt by Elsa's magic as children but that is it. She got hurt and trolls made her better. Later Elsa flees into the mountains so Anna hires a &#34;mountain man&#34; to take her to Elsa. Then Elsa cast a freezing spell on her and she needs true love's kiss. The story is over a page later. If you haven't seen the movie this will make zero sense. Since I had seen the movie I could follow. My daughter is three and just loved that it was a new way to see Anna and Elsa. Overall, not upset I made the purchase but I had higher expectations.   \n",

                     Albeit you'd never get into the book's story it'll keep you reading. But if for one person's whim can be a blackout and keep Vegas without water, I think that the State of Nevada has a very BIG problem as well as the whole country. If one simple woman thinks that she can do whatever she wants to Las Vegas's mob and get away with it... as it happened in the book... I think I better read Cinderella. It's more plausible.   \n",

enjoy Connelly's work but this Harry Bosch seemed rather tiresome.

I read some of the reviews from other Amazon Vine participants and realized that it wasn't going to be about the healing, but mostly about the abuse that she went through to get to the point where she was now.  As someone that has gone through abuse, I didn't want to read it.  I find it much harder to not have flashbacks of my life when I read through another person's tale.  I finally picked up this book on Saturday, and finished it late Saturday evening.  It was heart wrenching, and I traveled her journey with many tears.  It left me with a fairly sleepless night.  I honestly don't know how to review this more than giving a warning to someone (the 1 in 4 of us) that have been through a sexual trauma.  It's violent and graphic and regardless of where you are in your healing process, it brings up things you would rather not think about.  It is brutally honest though, and left me wishing the best for her.  I never thought that I would be rooting for a murderer, but I do hope that she continues to recover and move forward in her life.   \n",

                                        Being an avid cyclist, this is a book I should've loved, but it fell short of my expectations. For starters, there's nothing redeeming about Terry that makes me want to cheer for him and at the same time, he's not enough of a villain for me to enjoy rooting against him. In the first chapter, we learn that this attractive yet washed up 37-year-old retired cycling professional is engaged to age-appropriate Paula, sleeping with her 22-year-old daughter Susan (who is seriously dating his protegee Romain), and having a brief affair with a 19-year-old named Bobbie, whom he falls in love with after she loses her virginity to him in the backseat of his car on their first date. At the same time, neither Paula nor Romain has any clue about the infidelity and neither Terry nor Susan have any emotional complications with the affair. Then through the mixed up set of circumstances that cause Terry to end up in the Tour de France, he's just this flat, mopey, self-depricating lump of a man during the race. Without revealing the later half of the book, I'll just simply say that the characters are underdeveloped and behave in ways that I think are irrational and unexplained. Normal people have an emotional complication with having an affair with their mother's fiancee/fiancee's daughter. There's not enough of an explanation for why these people don't have a problem with it.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman   \n",

started reading it, but I'm glad I stuck with it.  EJ is a damaged woman, damaged by her mother who was too busy with her career and herself to be A mother.  Jess is a self-proclaimed angel who decides that EJ needs her specialized angel-type help.  She kidnaps EJ and takes her back to Washington for the eighth wedding of EJ's mother, and then the sparks fly!  I did not give this book 5 stars because 1) the slow start, and more importantly 2) the inserts of Lilly's (EJ's mother) writing which, although I got used to it and found it mildly interesting, was totally superfluous to the story.  Most of these ebooks could use some good editing.   \n",

Pat Conroy's writing. Still, in no way was my lack of experience with the author a bar to my enjoyment of The Death of Santini: The Story of a Father and His Son.I found this book to be very mature and very stimulating; as someone who has lost both parents, I found it very personally resonant in several key respects. However, there were some elements of Conroy's story I didn't find relatable personally, and to some extent that hindered my enjoyment of the book. It was also longer than I would have liked, but it's understandably hard to exclude things when one is dealing with such personal matters.I'd recommend this book to anyone who finds it productive to think about how our families make us who we are. I think you'll be touched by Pat Conroy's journey.Please be advised I got a free advance reader's copy through Goodreads Giveaways.   \n",

                  The Ghetto fabulous theme is a little much for me. I like Kiki's writing though when she does the mystery theme and less drugs and gangs. The Yoshi Lomax stories I like better.. I still have problems with the amount of typos and grammar situations. If you like the gangster theme, this is your book.. This is Part three of the saga of drug dealers and a family trying to stay alive in a mixed up world of drugs and violence.   \n",

started out with a bang.  went downhill fast.  too convoluted with too many characters, I was always back checking trying to keep them straight.  too many descriptive passages with too much information repeated too many times that didn't have anything to do with the moving the story along. too many corny references that had me rolling my eyes.  the book was well written as to grammar and spelling, but needs an editor big time for content.   \n",

                  I thought I had a good grounding in knowledge of Islam- but I was woefully under informed. An important book that any American/Westerner with children or grandchildren should read. Key takeaways are among others-Islam is both a religion and a political creed.The teachings of Islam create folks that do not think like we do - lieing and deception are honored if it furthers the goals of Islam.As Jefferson stated - our constitution in not a mutual suicide pact. The wisdom of Jefferson should not be ignored in our relationship with Islam.Absent major changes in teachings of Islam we in the west CAN NOT coexist with Islam!!   \n",

They are all coming of age. It is a summer of discovery for all of them which continues through the following decades that they remain in touch.It begins in the summer of 1974. Julie's father has just passed away, at the untimely age of 42. When she receives a scholarship to attend the camp, Spirit in the Woods, her mom decides it would be good for her to go. While there, she flourishes. When some teens get together in a camp tepee and decide to form a group that will continue to be best friends forever, into the future, she is flattered to be invited to attend; Ash and Goodman, (sister and brother), Jonah, Kathy, Ethan (an animation genius) and Julie, the newbie, round out the circle of six. When they call her Jules, she adopts the name ever after. She does comedy routines at camp and comes out of her shell. She and Ash remain best friends into adulthood and all of them remain friends, throughout the years, periodically getting together again. For the most part, they support each other and are positive influences in each other's lives.The story follows these characters from the summer of Nixon's resignation to the ten year anniversary of 9/11, when they are in their fifties. Each of their lives plays out in a different direction. They remain friends all through the ensuing years, some becoming more successful than others. Each finds their own way. Two of them marry, one is gay, one accuses another of rape, one marries someone outside the circle (Dan), and one runs off and assumes another identity in order to escape the errors of his ways. All of them are fully formed, and we live with them, their failures, successes, mistakes and conflicts as they age and face the exigencies of life.There is some crude language and also there are unnecessary sex scenes which add nothing to the story's development. From my perspective, relevant and important subjects, like intermarriage, motherhood, parental death, divorce, separation, the Aids epidemic, premarital sex, drug use, and even autism, are only casually referenced and not fully explored, while, at the same time, largely irrelevant, liberal political views run rampant, throughout the text, at every opportunity. Wealth and the evil it spawns, coupled with its alter ego, privation, a problem apparently caused by the rich, in the author's view, are mentioned as well. (The expression of the author's personal political views seems to be a very common theme running through the novels today. Authors seem to want to express their personal views and not so subtly plant references to them.)The story is sometimes repetitious as it is retold from different character's points of view as events play out.These are not perfect characters; they have flawed families and imperfect lives, with all of the sundry normal problems and not so normal ones in evidence. They have emotional trauma, mental and physical issues and even legal problems to deal with at various points of the narrative. All of the themes are knitted together in the end when the story comes full circle. There are villains and heroes.In the end, it is about life changes and changing needs as we age. It is about money and the lack of it, what money can buy and what money can destroy. It is about beauty and the lack of it. It is about the relevancy and irrelevancy of issues that sometimes seem so important at one stage of life and so trivial at another. Still, sometimes it takes almost a lifetime to work out the effects of some events in our lives, in order to move forward and live again. Life isn't fair and it isn't a fairy tale. It is not for sissies.Absent the political bias which flies off the pages expressing the author's dislike of conservative politics, it is a really \"interesting\" study of a group of teens as they grow and mature, learn how to make choices, some good and some bad, and come to realize that being \"interesting\" is in the eye of the beholder and its importance depends on circumstances and moments in time. There are many poignant moments, and moments of truth, witnessed by the reader for each of the characters. In the end, most of the characters are altruistic and soon discover that money does not always lift up the rich, but often corrupts them. It is a person's behavior, hopes and dreams that define them, not their money or position or their popularity and beauty.   \n",

                    This was told in 2person POV and it had really good flow to the story, never once getting off track or was hard to understand in fact it was a really easy story to read. The author did a unremarkable job with the writing style of this story I couldn't have been more happy to read another one from her. This was not only just a love story it was about people finding their true happiness and over-coming all their demons inside. And on that journey falling in love which was a plus if you ask me, It all worked out in the end.***I received this story for free in exchange for an honest review, see more of my review @ [...]   \n",
              "72   First I should start off by saying that I'm a pretty big Ted Dekker fan. I've been buying and reading his books for about the past 3 years now and just like most older fans, must say that I find his older faith-based, adventure-driven and emotional/relational/romantic material more inspired than his newer who-done-it fantastical supernatural material. Still, Dekker has kept up the exact same writing style throughout the years, and it's such a fantastic unique way with words and descriptions that never gets ahead of itself or tries to sound overly wordy or philosophical for its own sake... and I think it's what's kept him famous thus far, and what is also helping his fan base to grow.'Sinner' is a story based on the older 'Showdown,' and is also the last book in the Paradise Novel Series (though they say the 3 can be read in any order, which I disagree with), 'Showdown' being the first and 'Saint' being sort of a distance 2nd book that has no real alignment with this book's timeline.The characters from 'Showdown' are back as grown ups who work in the real world and have inherited supernatural powers (Billy can read minds, Darcy can influence people to do pretty much anything with the power of her voice and Johnney can have people see the true Kingdom of Heaven through one look of his blinded eyes). Yea, if this all sounds far-fetched so far, you haven't heard anything yet.The story takes place in the near future, around 2035, where the United States is basically at a sort of religious and cultural civil war where extremism in religion has reached a boiling point, Christians are looked down upon and no longer respected and mostly tolerated, and Islam has become the religion of choice in America. Without going into much detail the story is basically about Billy and Darcy being hired by the U.S. government to use their powers to influence people in the States out of all this racial and religious tension, as well as eventually influencing foreign nations to agree with the U.S. on pretty much whatever the heck it wants. Eventually they decide to enact an Amendment that prohibits religious expression and Johnney being the only devout Christian of the 3 decides to take this head on with his own small army of 3, which eventually becomes 3000 in the small town of Paradise (the town focused on in the first book 'Showdown') to fight the bill and keep religious expression alive for the sake of Christianity.Now the reason I gave this book only 3 stars is because of how much it tries to cover so many subjects at one time, and eventually using so much time to describe all the problems and tensions going on in America that Dekker must sacrifice character development in the process. Marsuvees Black (the villian from the first book, again, 'Showdown') is back but only makes brief appearances as he isn't necessarily a vital part of the story. In fact, the problem is that NOTHING is really a vital part of a story that seems to be using so many unrelated things to tell one central story, that the reader simply just stops really caring about trying to guess what will happen or feeling tense or thrilled about anything and is basically just forced to sit back and accept everything that's going on - thus leaving the reader out of any sort of relation they might have with the book. So what keeps this story afloat? Mostly Ted Dekker's writing, he's a good writer, a very good one, and the reader (most especially his fans) will keep pages turning to see when things will finally start to click together and make sense.Still, things never really do make sense as the story has a tendency to become pretty far-fetched and downright supernaturally hokey (an example being when Johnney pits himself with both Billy and Darcy in what seems to be a power-struggle STARING contest... the reader can only role their eyes at such moments. Or when a teenage rebel named Kat is at school and tries to stop a mob of extremist teenage Muslims from throwing things in the cafeteria shouting 'may the will of Allah be done!' and begins yelling how Jesus taught we are all to love each other, and said teenagers and school are never mentioned again... the reader just feels like they're getting put through filler material).Anyway, this all leads to a very cheesy and anticlimactic ending in which the battle of good and evil is ended for the moment, and at the last 2 chapters the reader already pretty much knows what's going to happen and is personally tired of all the supernatural far-fetched and forced Hocus Pocus that I would not be surprised if you just skimmed through he last 20 pages just to have the book done with. That is of course to the readers who haven't already grown impatient by the middle of the book. It almost made me laugh listening to characters continuously repeat \"kill him! kill him already!\" only to have the villain laugh and smile repeating the predictable \"you can't kill me\" type lines. Yes, this type of dialogue actually goes on for an ENTIRE CHAPTER by the end of the book. More impatient and picky readers would probably palm their faces saying 'Ted, just end it already, this is embarrassing.'And just to add another tidbit - the \"villain,\" Marsuvees Black I believe was excellent in the first book, 'Showdown,' and had a lot of depth and character, but in this one just comes off as NOTHING like his earlier self, and just another stereotypical bad guy who laughs and talks too much, but doesn't ever really do anything bad to anyone at all. You don't hate him or are afraid of him, you just wonder when he'll die already.Ted Dekker fans will most likely be disappointed by how ridiculous this book becomes at times, and though some aspects of the story become interesting (particularly Kat's character which to much dismay was pitifully WASTED, and Darcy's and Billy's exchanges with each other earlier in the book before the last quarter where everyone just seems to keep yelling all the time), but for the sake of a whole, what kills this book is both the poor pacing, disjointed scenarios, uneven storytelling, and huge sacrifice in any sort of meaningful and in-depth character development. You simply don't care very much about these people or relate to ANY of them in the least bit. Ted is a great writer and while this book wasn't terrible, it was merely OK, but in comparison with his earlier works, this just doesn't hold a candle. He needs to get back to the magic that made his earlier, more romantic books so special (Thr3e, Blessed Child, When Heaven Weeps, Showdown, Circle Trilogy) and take a break from these stretches in trying to write overly dramatic supernatural thrillers.   \n",

It is in no way a \"history of America's involvement and extrication\" in Vietnam.  What it is is a very detailed account, from Kissinger's poing of view, of the laborious negotiations with the North Vietnamese to end the Vietnam War in as honorable a way as possible.I can't say it was a bad book.  I learned a lot.  I finished it with a new appreciation for the difficult situation we were in.  It changed some of my opinions about this war and reinforced others.  But, a history of America's involvement in the war it was not.  There is anectotal information on the broader military and political context at best.  Most of the book is a meticulous account of the negotiations between Kissinger and the N. Vietnamese.   \n",

I took time out to read this small, illustrated, 51-page book.  I wasn't paying attention to anything but the price and the author when I ordered it.  I guess Jose Saramago isn't in the habit of writing short stories otherwise his publisher could just as easily have waited to include it in his next collection.The story, as I understood it, is that of a man who is searching for a new start, a new world.  He doesn't seem to express any objections to his present world, he just wants a boat so he can go find an unknown island.  If I try to tell too much more of the plot, I'll run the risk of this review being longer than the \"book\".  In the end, I understood the plot to mean that often it is the journey, rather than the destination that matters.  The determination is greater than the result.This is a nice enough story but it doesn't warrent its' own issuance.  I mean, it isn't THAT good.  I'll read more of Saramago and I'll be glad to sing his praises many times, I'm sure.  I'll just pay a little more attention to what I'm ordering in the future.   \n",

                                       This is the first book I have read by David Weber. I mean no insult to him, or his fans but I have to say there were times when I almost gave up on this book and put it on the shelf (To later list for resale on Ebay!)\"\"IT WAS A RELIEF TO FINISH IT!\"\"Too much \"POLITICS!\" I realize politics (IN MODERATION!) can make a good story,, but that is all this book is!! Maybe that is the \"POINT!\" but I had a hard time with it. If I had known this was a \"Political S.F.\" novel I would have thought twice about buying it.There were too many characters that you had to remember or you would lose track of the story. The index in the back was not much help.The story was way too long. (I think that is my main issue with it.) I will say it started off very good and there were some good moments toward the end: Some good Naval battles! Although the battle strategies did not make much sense to me. I am a landlubber though, so what do I know??After slogging through it I expected more than a \"TO BE CONTINUED\" ending.   \n",

canada, children, death, depression, disabilities, ghosts, kindle, mystery, read, strong-femThis is an adult book because of the fear it could cause in anyone but especially the young. It brought out my anxiety. Any mother would be anxious as she reads this!This is in the author's country, Canada. It isn't over emphasized but makes you want to go there. It sounds like it must be absolutely beautiful!This is about the kidnapping, torturing, dismembering and killing of children, which makes it a book I will never read again. I will forever have nightmares from this!The main character's son has a disability. He is unable to speak. Yes, you do find out why.Ghosts waft about and take over at times, be prepared. As usual, they need help.Yes, I read this with text-to-speech on my Kindle.I don't usually read mysteries, neither do I read books that will keep me awake or cause nightmares. The author leaves all the clues you need to solve the mystery. You do see it coming. Even still, as gruesome as this mystery is, you keep reading in hopes of closure for the poor mother who has been through enough.Strong fem. She just doesn't know it. She hides from her own strength in her alcohol. But when she is more sober, facing her demons, so-to-speak, you know that any person would want to escape this mess, any way they could.If I were into crime mysteries I think I would give this five stars. I prefer books like Cheryl Kaye Tardif's Whale Song.   \n",

my religion, it is apparently a staple of some other belief systems. The author comes from such a tradition. Mix this broad swath with a healthy salting of \"oh isn't this cool\", and you get an idea of flavor of the book.The writing in the work is certainly readable, sometimes funny, even sometimes irreverent and Thurber-esque. And if you're looking for insight into a xtian theologian's view of other cultures it's an interesting read. But don't go to this book looking for a complete history or economic analysis of the cultures involved, and for goodness sake don't go looking here for information on any religion but the author's own (and even there, his interpretations are apparently iconoclastic).The book is comedy. Sometimes intentional, sometimes not. If that's what you were looking for, go for it. But take it with a pillar of salt.   \n",

She had an almost insatiable hunger for love combined with ridiculous taste in men. She had a short attention span. She was, as Brown points out again and again, \"a tactician,\" who often exhibited reckless disregard for the long-term consequences of her actions. All true.And yet, even after all this is disclosed, the woman we see is am ambitious, empathic woman, a mother who loves her sons, and a charismatic force of nature with a nearly undefeatable spirit. I don't know if it's Brown's writing or the power of Diana's personality that make her someone you root for, even as she races toward that sad end in Paris.My biggest quibble with the book is NOT ENOUGH PHOTOS. Over and over, Brown makes reference to this iconic photograph, or to that famous dress she wore, or how Diana's style changed to reflect her evolving personality ... and it would be nice if those photos were included in the book. I found this frustrating.   \n",

                                                        I bought this for my own personal use and have finished about one fourth of the puzzles. A neat feature is that you can tear out the puzzles to work on outside the book itself. My only disappointment with the puzzles is that many of them are more difficult than I prefer, in that there are a lot of what I consider esoteric clues and words that even well-educated persons will not know.   \n",

                  After inheriting her grandmother's cottage, Chelsea decides to visit the cottage to honor her Gram's last wishes.  Thirty-three year old Chelsea is still looking for love never finding the right man's man.  Brandon has a secret guilt that he can't seem to let go.  Grandmother Brooke has lived with a deep secret and questions all her life and her family has always questioned why she never returned to her beloved cottage.  There she finds family secrets and a handsome doctor, Brandon, who has his own mysterious pass. This laid-back read switches from Chelsea's contemporary story to Brooke's (Gram) love story which took place during WWII.While the secrets aren't stunning or surprising, they are revealed in a way that maintains interest throughout the book.  This book reminds me a bit of the The Violets of March by Sarah Jio but the feel of the book and the writing style is different.  While I liked the book and the characters, I didn't love them.  I thought the relationship between Chelsea and Brandon was rushed and not as believable while I loved the relationship of Bill, Brooke, and Greg.  I enjoyed the moments in the past more than the present.  However, I think I liked the unwinding of the story most of all.   \n",

The writing's fairly taut and fresh and the plot cracks along but the modern tone, though justified by the surprise plot twist at the end, seems remarkably out of place. We get a fairly good tour of the English (and Welsh) countryside as our reluctant viking protagonist learns to raid and kill in the best tradition of his forebears, gets lost from his raiding party and hooks up with a lovely, if mysterious, female companion and finally finds his shipmates again, only to get swept overboard, with the girl, and end up in the monastery at Lindisfarne just prior to the historical raid on that site which kicked off the full scale viking age in England -- which was to trouble the natives there for the next hundred years or so. We get an oddly bracing picture of these vikings too, professional warriors that they were, as they ready themselves for each upcoming encounter (not unlike the limbering-up exercises of a modern football team about to meet the \"other side\" out on the gridiron in a friendly match) -- you almost have to believe in the realism of it all, despite the warm fuzzy feeling you get once you've really gotten to know these boys. Even Thorfinn Skullsplitter seems like the kind of guy you wouldn't mind splitting a beer with -- assuming that's all he's in the mood for cleaving. But the dragon stuff seems rather forced and out of place. And the end, clever as it is, only adds to the sense that this book and this author didn't quite know where they wanted to go with the story. The protagonist's \"voice\" lapses into a rather sophomoric, counter-cultural patois as the tale winds down, which is both jarring and debilitating to the rest of the tale. And, though it's justified by the ending, the ending itself is discordant with what went before. You may guess it from the way the story moves, but I doubt you'll figure out the locale.The surprise ending in this one seems to have pleased many readers but I found it a bit off-putting, myself, turning what had seemed to me to be a good, and nicely paced, historical yarn into something a bit too self-concious and cute. I prefer my viking tales with a larger dash of authenticity so the abrupt plot twist which brings this one to a close, left me a bit cold.But it's nicely written and holds the reader to the end.SWM   \n",

by Ms. Saintcrow, and liked them both--particularly the Dante Valentine books.  This new endeavor, \"The Demon's Librarian\" is a good read as well, but you should note it is a paranormal romance,and thus the plot focus is on the romance first, paranormal fantasy second.I enjoyed the story, the worldbuilding and characterizations were good, the writing overall well done; but because this was a romance the book was a bit lightweight for me.  But don't let me discourage you from reading \"The Demon's Librarian;\" any complaints aside, I'll be buying the sequel.  (And as a side note:  I know it's not the author's fault, but that cover is ugly!)   \n",

Jackson to succeed. He has done so much for his country that he should have every success he dreams of. I hope and believe he will continue to improve.As others have pointed out, the editing is poor and the author clearly needs to learn better punctuation and grammer, and he should take the time to check the meanings of words. He all too often either misuses words or chooses terms that are just not quite apt.The protagonist has every reason to be bitter, but the effects of his treatment does not seem to have affected him permanently in any consequential way. He also is amazingly successful given his naivete and poor judgment. He spills crucial secrets about himself with the slightest nudge. Young people sometimes do such stupid things, but in real life such carelessness brings failures, betrayals, and dissappointments. This guy, though, rarely stubs his toes in such situations. Likewise, going to every greater success very quickly can be exhilarating if handled well, but in this case it is perilously close to boring at timesOn the other hand, the author has imagination and has created an interesting and not terribly derivative world. If he continually improves his writing and plot development, that could bring him great success.   \n",

book/series around for a while now, often popping up in Amazon's &#34;customers' who bought this book also bought&#34; recommendations. I finally succumbed and bought Spider's Bite. Unfortunately, I was right. It wasn't for me.Strong characters, lots of action, impressive world building and some sexual tension - but I couldn't get past the level of violence.It's funny. GA Aiken's Dragon series is violent, but I adjusted to that. Perhaps because it's tempered with humour and love and family.Spider's Bite was just too strong for me. But if you're not freaked by a bit of blood and revenge, I can see why this series has its committed fans.   \n",

                                           This is a decent beginner's book to chakras, meditation and balancing energy.  It's not very in depth, but it will get you started.  There are better guides out there for this subject in my opinion.   \n",

Seems like old plots from the previous Malory's were reused.  If this had been the first Malory novel I had read then it would have also been the last.  JL seems to be propping the last 2 Malory stories up with the more lovable Malory characters.  I think there would have been a better way to go with Jeremy's story; as with Derek's story, James and Tony seemed to be the hero's.  I would like to see a book for Drew Anderson but not if he can't stand on his own. I was so hoping Jeremy's story would come about from a bet with his cousin Amy.  Jeremy used to be a lovable rake; in this book he didn't seem like a rake at all. Kinda boring.  Wasn't really thrilled with Danny either.   \n",

                First off, Herbert has done an incredible job building and detailing his world of Arrakis.  There is a clearly defined mythology, religion, political system, philosophy and ecology in this world.  Despite all the introduced terminology in the book, I feel it is easy enough for the reader to pick up and understand these new terms.Having said that, I did not find the main characters, or many of the other characters, interesting.  Paul and Jessica are unappealing characters because of their seeming penchant for all of their actions to be based on political reasons.  While there is a need for it at times, it seems like all of their actions are made for manuvering their survival on Arrakis.  I feel that the better characters are Gurney Halleck and Dr. Yueh.  Both men have detailed backstories that fully explain their motivations in the actions they take, which are made for a myriad of reasons, not just political.I felt that the book would have benefitted from more of a balance between action and political intrigue.  The action sequences that did take place were ok, and would have kept my interest more.I realize that I am in the minority with my opinion of Dune.  I give Herbert a lot of credit for creating a fully imagined and detailed world, and this novel was no doubt groundbreaking at the time of publication.  For me, the book would have benefitted more if the same detail had been paid to his characterizations.   \n",

Add to this a narrator whose first-person, documental prose discusses everything from his father being transferred to a labor camp to, at the end of the novel, his blas&eacute; reaction to his father's death in the camps.  Thinking back on it, this was one of the central problems for me: his reactions, even to the most horrific experiences (like finding out that there were crematoria in the camps), was unconvincingly cool and aloof.In one of the last sentences of \"Fateless,\" Gyorgy says \"Everybody will ask me about the deprivations, the `terror of the camps,' but for me, the happiness there will always be the most memorable experience, perhaps.  Yes, that's what I'll tell them the next time they ask me: about the happiness in those camps.\"  I wonder what survivors today would say about that sentence; I do not deny that some might find it interesting, but I would be curious about the average reaction that a Holocaust survivor had to it.  What I find most disconcerting about this is not that he could have found happiness in the camps.  We are forced to find our own ways to survive psychologically, after all.  But nothing in the book leading up to that sentence would have led the reader to believe that it was true.  As a result, the whole thing ended up feeling false, more like a series of diary entries than a coherent, lucid account of concentration camp life.  I use the term \"diary entries\" here because, while so many people claim that this is biographical or semi-biographical novel, Kertesz has purportedly denied this is true.But I should note some important qualifications.  I didn't read the novel in Hungarian, I may have been in a particularly non-receptive mood while reading it, et cetera.  Another reviewer wrote, \"In the end I remained as detached and as unengaged as Gyorgy himself.\"  I agree.  And because of that, I'm afraid it will not stick with me in the same way, say, that Primo Levi's \"The Periodic Table\" has.I was glad this was not, as so much popular Holocaust fiction is, a simplistic story of \"good triumphing over evil.\"  Kertesz never turns the events in the camps into some gratuitous pornography of atrocity after atrocity, leaving us to sanctimoniously shake our heads in disapproval.  How true is it?  In some ways, I hope I will never find out.  But the sincerity of his literary effort and vision are not something I cannot call into question.   \n",

I will give the author credit for offering  a foreword that goes into the geology and palentology of his scenario. I won't nitpick any further on this: It's the author's setting, it's a given, and what the reader wants is to see is how well he uses it.As prose, this book is a step back from Alten's The Loch, which I thought a very good novel. Hell's Aquarium uses a breathless style with lots of dashes and exclamation points in the narrative.  Alten's work in The Loch showed he didn't need that sort of gimmickry, and I'm not sure why he uses it here.Most of the characters are three-dimensional: Alten has improved on this from book to book. His strength, as always, is fast-moving action, and there are some real page-turner moments. Alten has a knack for popular culture: I loved the Internet contest that resulted in naming two captive Megalodons Mary-Kate and Ashley. A final thing I liked was the ending, not for its plausibility, but for springing a genuine surprise about who lives and who dies.Alten likes to pile on the creatures and maximize their sizes.  This is ok: it's fiction, and if Peter Benchley can use a 100-foot squid, Alten can use a 122-foot Liopleurodon. (I liked his 25-foot evolved form of the vampire squid Vampyroteuthis infernalis - that would be scary as hell in real life.) It's not clear how creatures from eras over 200 million years apart could have ended up in this habitat, although I'll buy anything that allows bringing my favorite predator Dunkleosteus on stage.  Alten takes pains to emphasize there's a complete food web in the \"aquarium,\" although, like Peter Jackson's take on Skull Island, it still seems too slanted toward megapredators. All the big reptiles are here (evolved gills and all), along with a squadron of sharks and even a monster turtle. This makes for an exciting series of beast-on-beast conflicts as the humans bascially try to avoid becoming snacks. Alten has some good moments of description concerning the creatures and their dark, cold, deep habitat.As a cryptozoological researcher, I kept thinking of Bernard Heuvelmans' dissection of sea-serpent reports into as many as nine species. Alten's beasts could cover all those categories and then some. There hasn't really been a mention of cryptozoology in the Meg series since the first book, and it would have been fun to throw in a prominent cryptozoologist to react to the fact that, while cryptozoology has been chasing a new shark here and a giant eel there, there's been a horde of spectacular creatures unguessed-at.The level of cooperation and intelligence shown by some of Alten's sharks goes beyond what we know of real sharks, although the Megs, at least, have had 60 million years to evolve this way, so mark that as a permissible fiction-author liberty. At the end, two escaped Megs are setting themselves up as new apex predators of their own patch of the coastal Pacific, violently displacing the orcas which have been used to being on top. I'll be curious to see whether Alten follows that up in the next sequel. There's some interesting science he could go into, if he so chooses, about what would happen in an event like that.I thought the third Meg novel was a little better written than this one.  I thought The Loch was better still, and it puzzles me that Alten has slipped back from the quality (in this reader's opinion, of course) of his best novel.Overall, Hell's Aquarium is what it's supposed to be, which is fun. It's like going to a Transformers film. You wonder about plot holes and implausible escapes, but you came to see the robots in action. You pick up an Alten novel to see the creatures in action. Hell's Aquarium gives you what you pay for.   \n",

The first part of the book dragged and then about mid point, it picked up steam and then was over.   \n",

Plus it started off kind of slow.. Not to mention there was a lot of internal dialogue going on. But let me just say by the time i got to the last page i gave myself a thunk in the head for not reading it when i first got it.Basically yes. Lots of internal stuff. i tend to skim those parts in every book anyways.. but otherwise. i cant wait for the next one. i made up theories about the series.. i'm just waiting for them to be confirmed now.   \n",

didn't find this book to offer any startling revelations.  I had to read it for a seminar, and found myself skimming the later sections of the book.  It was well written and easy to read.  He just could have said what he had to say in fewer pages.   \n",

    This book is okay. It isn't fantastic, but it's not bad, either. On the positive side, I really liked the message and the story. Shelby is a sweet girl and is a great example of paying it forward. I like the way she worked hard all summer to create something that would benefit other people. I also really liked Mr. T. He is a wonderful, grandfatherly figure that takes the initiative to spend quality time with a child.On the downside, I'm not sure this would appeal to the target age group. The writing was alright, but it was a little too straight forward. The book also had a lot of filler - passages that didn't really seem to have any purpose. For example, there is a lot of discussion of measurements and if they should stain or paint the boards they were working on. The illustrations were just okay for me. Didn't love them, didn't hate them.Overall, this is a sweet book about an elderly man and a young girl spending their summer making other people's lives better. I think adults will enjoy it more than kids, but you never know.   \n",

There is no answer to questions such as whether a terrorist can legitimately be tortured to reveal the location of a bomb, or whether an innocent life can be sacrificed to save many lives. What the book does have, however,  is Mill's revised version of utilitarianism that is important because it plays a major role in his other works such as \"Liberty\".Much of the book explains and agrees with Bentham's version of utilitarianism that has no place for rights and replaces the concept of good/evil with pleasure/pain, but Mill's version of utilitarianism has an important difference - the claim that some pleasures are intrinsically superior to others, and if this is so then utilitarianism should strive to enable everybody to enjoy the superior pleasures.Mill defines utilitarianism as the \"Greatest Happiness Principle\" that judges \"actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\"  In this he is following Bentham's definition, but Bentham had devised a \"felicific calculus\" to determine the amount of pleasure (and hence moral worth) arising from any given action. It depended on things such as the intensity, duration and number of people affected. Bentham did not believe that one pleasure is in any way better than another except in terms of quantity. He wrote, for example, that \"Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry.\"Mill disagrees with this relativism, arguing that \"some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.\" In other words, quality is more important than quantity. Here we see the elitism that we find in all Mill's works. He asks how one can judge between the pleasure derived by two people from different actions and he answers that the person of what he calls \"higher faculties\" is the one to judge, if he can understand the relative merits of both actions and the other person cannot. Translating to a modern context we might ask why Mill would believe a Shakespeare play to be \"better\" than a TV reality show. Mill would claim that the person of \"higher faculties\" who fully appreciated Shakespeare would be able to see the merits of both and hence judge, whilst the other person could only appreciate the reality show and be unable to judge the relative merits of both.Mill seems to ditch the pleasure principle almost entirely at one point when suggesting that those with higher faculties are likely to find it more difficult to be happy because they realize the world is imperfect. But that realization does not make them envy the happiness of those with lower capabilities. In Mill's famous words\"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.\"It follows for Mill that if some pleasures are superior to others then it would be a good thing if more people could enjoy the higher pleasures. Mill believes that utilitarianism should aim at the general advancement of mankind for it can \"only attain its end by the general cultivation of nobleness of character.\"This edition of \"Utilitarianism\" also contains Mill's 1868 speech on capital punishment delivered to the English Parliament. Mill supports the use of capital punishment for murder and has two main arguments:1. Capital punishment is much more effective as a deterrent than any alternative.2. Capital punishment is more humane than incarceration for life, which Mill assumes to be the only alternative to the death penalty. He writes: \"What comparison can there really be, in point of severity, between consigning a man to the short pang of a rapid death, and immuring him in a living tomb, there to linger out what may be a long life in the hardest and most monotonous toil, without any of its alleviations.\"Nobody of Mill's generation contemplated the modern situation where many murderers in Britain as in most other   \n",

                                I am a huge fan of apocalyptic fiction and as a Brit living in the states I have a particular fondness for these stories when they are set in the UK.The premise is good, Britain is flooded and once the floodwaters subside the survivors have to get down to the business of surviving and in true apocalyptic fashion they decide to go on  a quest to find safety.Unfortunately Morris doesnt seem to really want to write a disaster novel, there is no real explanation as to what caused the flood and the emerging enemy is never really explained.  Are they aliens or a form of creature from the depths of the sea which is now evolving.I really wanted to like this book but never getting any bigger picture of the disaster or even some sort of explanation really did leave me cold.The characters are an interesting bunch and Morris actually writes them intelligently and quite believably. The addition of a disabled character posed some unique problems for the survivors which I enjoyed.Maybe if Morris writes a sequel with some answers I may find myself appreciating this book more but as it stands at the moment I ultimately found myself cheated that the author did not give any form of conclusion but left you hanging.   \n",

                                                   I remember reading Shirley Jackson's story The Lottery in school.  I was a book of her stories which includes The Lottery.  Unfortunately, I didn't care for too many of the stories in the book.  Every story I read was depressing and the characters were hopeless, helpless, and after reading a few, I had my fill.  I did enjoy reading The Lottery again, but that was the only story I enjoyed.   \n",

and I thoughtThe Da Vinci Codewas a fantastic read...fun, great twists, cool story, nice little historical mystery deal. Great. Fast-paced with lots of cliff-hangers, which I totally dig. Lost Symbol has plenty of cliff-hangers, but this time the pay-off just isn't there. The bad guy kinda sucks, he's weird and that's good, but his big motivation is telegraphed way early on so his big reveal was kinda spoiled. Also, the shocking revelation that would overturn the entire country? Really? That's all you could come up with? Bleh. Then the BIG final mystery...I really felt cheated. That's it?! That's all there is? Wow, what an amazing let down. And the epilogue was just a waste of 30 pages. Everything about the book prior to that was good. But the ending was so deflating and uninteresting that it demolished everything that came before it. What a shame...I still like Dan Brown and Robert Langdon, but I hope they didn't just jump the shark on this one. Solving the codes and stuff on the cover was more fun than reading the ending of this book. Maybe if you only read the first 350 pages and let the ending be a mystery...that might be the best way to enjoy this one. One of the worst endings to a fun book that I have read in a long time.   \n",

I was most excited to read Sienna Mynx's books because I find her work very enjoyable but I could not stand the heroine in the book, Kyra.  She really, really, really annoyed me.  I found her to be immature and I could not imagine why a man like Renaldo who was very grounded would have found an instant connection to her besides sex.  Hopefully, Kyra grows up in the next book.  Pepper Pace's book was interesting to me and I enjoyed it.  I will say that her work is normally not something that I buy because her style is different than what I normally enjoy (this is my opinion) but I will buy the sequel to her book.  Latrivia Nelson's book was also enjoyable and I liked the strong and quiet hero.  I have been a fan of Latrivia since reading Ivy's Twisted Vine but I hope she comes up with the sequel in a reasonable amount of time and does not overpromise when the sequel will come out to her fans.  Aliya Burke's book was pretty interesting as well.  I struggled with Affrica's brogue but I appreciate a different kinda heroine.  I also thought Reeve was a jerk but he had enough redeeming qualities about him that I rooted for him.  Tiana Laveen is a gifted writer and I enjoyed reading about Julian in Tattooed Moon but I found him to be a little too preachy which is common with some of the male characters in her others books.  The other author's books were ok, not bad but not super exciting either.  I will say that the amount of material that we received for such a reasonable price is absolutely outstanding and I am encouraged by the strong amount of fan support these ladies have going for them.  Again, this is my opinion and I hope all of these authors succeed.   \n",

                                                   What was most fascinating about this book was that it started off almost in the middle of a story, as if you turned on the TV and watched a flick with out seeing the beginning. And then the book ended the same way, as if you turned the movie off with out seeing the conclusion. If I did not know that there were several other books in the series, I think that I would have been reviewing Freedom's Landing in a better light. I say this because this story felt more like a dream that you look back upon after waking. The beginning might be hazy and the end is where the alarm clock took over.This is a pretty crazy tale; aliens invade earth and round up slaves from major cities. They use whips to force people into the ships as if they were cattle. If you read the book think about how strange some aspects of her story are. The dialogue is pretty bad, but then again, I think she was aiming towards a younger audience than myself, so I forgive her for that.If you're looking for a good female science fiction writer and were seeing if McCaffrey was a starting point on that endeavor, pass her by for the time being. Instead concentrate on Connie Willis and her book 'To say nothing of the dog.'   \n",

I have made a lot of jellies and jams from this book and my family loves them.  I made salsa as well, and it was very good.There are two things I didn't care for - if I was more interested in pressure canning, I would have been very disappointed.  There is very little in this book for pressure canning.  Second, I agree with other reviewers who have commented that the yields are far off.  They are not only far off - they are ridiculously far off.  I consistantly run 2-3 and sometimes 4 jars short of what the recipe claims I should have using the amount of ingredients the recipe says to use.  This is very frustrating when you the recipe says you should have 10 8 oz jars of jam and you have 5.  I understand what I did wrong with the tomato salsa recipe - strain your tomatoes AFTER you skin and quarter them, that way you have more tomatoes and probably more salsa.  I haven't figured out why the yields for the jams are so low.Many people note that they the Ball book much better than the USDA Guide because the Guide is confusing, and I can see why they would say that.  If you want REALLY EASY to understand canning recipes, look for the user manuals that came with the pressure canners back in the 1950s (when the writers thought all women were dumber than a box of hammers - you can probably find them on E-Bay).  They are very easy to follow, and some have yield charts, i.e., if you have x amount of tomatoes you will get y number of jars.  I have an Old National No. 7 canner - the forerunner of Presto - with wooden handles that is probably 60-70 years old - its manual (The Modern Guide to Home Preserving) was extremely helpful and practical.</td>\n",

Along the way, they converse about their thoughts and feelings, reminisce about their childhoods...and then, out of nowhere, it appears that the plane has been hijacked.The players/perpetrators are Bruno, Stephen, Tom...and possibly unknown others.But this story is not at all what it seems.  In the opening paragraphs, Alice, telling this story as the first-person narrator, is at an Institute where role-playing and anti-terrorist games are the order of the day.  In a Post 9/11 world, referred to throughout this book as The Big Terrible, the anti-terrorism advocates have turned to in-fighting, dividing into the Insurgents and the Brain Worms.Thus, on Alice's flight to Melilla, there is an aura of game-playing all around the participants:  Unwilling participants who are subjected to numerous experiences which, in retrospect, may not have actually been life-threatening.Themes of rivalry (including sibling rivalry) appear throughout the story, as do themes of questioning reality and truth.  Which stories does the reader believe?  Who is doing what and why?  Did events unfold as we thought, or is it all the \"effect of living backwards\"?In a conversation between Edith and Alice, we glean a bit more about the \"experiment\":\"Talk about controlled experiment.\"\"Or maybe we're just the controlled test audience,\" Edith said.  \"In the not too distant future--depending on our valuable feedback--people will be signing up for this sort of experiment willingly.  People will pay to be hijacked, so that they can attain some transcendent, triumphant sense of resignation about their slogging, awful lives.  The motto could be:  No matter how far you go, there you are again.  You know.  Familiarity.  Remember what Dad said about familiarity.\"\"It breeds intent.\"\"He said people don't want new things.  People don't want to be surprised.\"As we ponder the themes, the ethical questions posed throughoutThe Effect of Living Backwards, we also hear the narratives of several \"passengers\" on the \"hijacked flight.\"  But their versions of truth are just that...their versions.  Or so we come to believe.But what is the true story here?  And how do Alice and Edith fare?  What will ultimately happen, and how will each of them resolve the issues?As a reader, I felt confused most of the time, intrigued some of the time, and quite happy to finally finish this \"experiment.\"  Boldly contrived and brilliantly articulated, the author shows the reader her talent for philosophical issues and experiments.

There was little discussion of the human element, the sadness many of the apricot growing families must have felt as the experienced the passing of their way of life.  Also missing was an adequate discussion of how the rare micro-climate of the Santa Clara Valley allowed apricots, particularly the king of apricots the Blenheim variety, to flourish as perhaps nowhere else on earth. (The last apricot tree the author's parents planted on their property was a Blenheim). The California's Central Valley, is too hot for Blenheim's.

The book describes what they mean by strength and warmth, then goes into detailed examples of how these work in real life. We all have elements of each. The trick is to balance them out. Too much strength without warmth can leave people behind, while too much warmth without strength can leave people vulnerable. One area the authors discuss is public speaking, and how it can be difficult to practice. One thing they didn't mention was Toastmasters, an organization that allows people to practice public speaking in a controlled environment. I realize now why this book is required reading at Harvard. They also mention the 1988 presidential debate where Michael Dukakis answered a question about his wife's rape and murder as though he'd been asked the time of day.

Seven years later, he is in China, working as a trader in the then Chinese system in which Western traders were kept in a compound in Canton, spied on by the translators provided to them by their hosts. The translator supplied to Kyle is a young man called Jin Kang, to whom Kyle feels strangely drawn. This is explained some days later when Kyle discovers that Jin Kang is really Troth Mei-Lian Montgomery, daughter of a Scottish trader and Chinese concubine, now both dead. Troth had been taken in by the Chinese overseer of the trading system, Chenqua, who took advantage of her fluency in both languages by making her work for him in disguise.Kyle, frustrated by the restraints on Europeans, wants to explore more of China, and Troth offers to be his guide on condition that he help her get to Scotland. She agrees, and in disguise they make their way to the Temple of Hashon, becoming lovers en route. Kyle, though, makes it clear that he isn't capable of loving; Troth lies and says that she's not looking for love.On the return journey, disaster strikes: Kyle's disguise is uncovered and he is arrested and sentenced to death. Troth creeps into his cell on the pretence of administering English deathbed rites, and Kyle offers to marry her, Scottish-style, to protect her and give her a means of getting back to England.Believing that the death sentence was carried out - she heard the sound of the firing squad - Troth makes her way to England, arriving at Warfield to tell Dominic that his brother is dead. Mere weeks later, a frail but alive Kyle turns up; his captors had only played with him, pretending on several occasions to  execute him. So he and Troth are bound in a marriage of dubious legitimacy, and which neither believes the other wants.Where do they go from here?This is another Putney book I'd put off reading for some time; the Chinese element was offputting to me, since I don't care for Asian/Oriental settings and didn't like the latter two Silk books much for that reason. However, less than half of this book is actually set in China, and although Putney does her usual job of making the detail authentic (hence lots of stuff about feng shui and tai chi and chi energy and so on, most of which I skimmed rather than read), her usual skill at building a romance flows through the book.The scenes leading up to Kyle and Troth's parting and Kyle's 'death', as well as the depiction of Kyle in captivity and the mock executions, were poignant and emotional - Putney at her best. And I don't agree with those who argue that the latter part of the book is less interesting: the emotional divide and miscommunication between Kyle and Troth is also Putney at her best.

For starters, there's nothing redeeming about Terry that makes me want to cheer for him and at the same time, he's not enough of a villain for me to enjoy rooting against him. In the first chapter, we learn that this attractive yet washed up 37-year-old retired cycling professional is engaged to age-appropriate Paula, sleeping with her 22-year-old daughter Susan (who is seriously dating his protegee Romain), and having a brief affair with a 19-year-old named Bobbie, whom he falls in love with after she loses her virginity to him in the backseat of his car on their first date. At the same time, neither Paula nor Romain has any clue about the infidelity and neither Terry nor Susan have any emotional complications with the affair. Then through the mixed up set of circumstances that cause Terry to end up in the Tour de France, he's just this flat, mopey, self-depricating lump of a man during the race. Without revealing the later half of the book, I'll just simply say that the characters are underdeveloped and behave in ways that I think are irrational and unexplained.

They are all coming of age. It is a summer of discovery for all of them which continues through the following decades that they remain in touch.It begins in the summer of 1974. Julie's father has just passed away, at the untimely age of 42. When she receives a scholarship to attend the camp, Spirit in the Woods, her mom decides it would be good for her to go. While there, she flourishes. When some teens get together in a camp tepee and decide to form a group that will continue to be best friends forever, into the future, she is flattered to be invited to attend; Ash and Goodman, (sister and brother), Jonah, Kathy, Ethan (an animation genius) and Julie, the newbie, round out the circle of six. When they call her Jules, she adopts the name ever after. She does comedy routines at camp and comes out of her shell. She and Ash remain best friends into adulthood and all of them remain friends, throughout the years, periodically getting together again. For the most part, they support each other and are positive influences in each other's lives.The story follows these characters from the summer of Nixon's resignation to the ten year anniversary of 9/11, when they are in their fifties. Each of their lives plays out in a different direction. They remain friends all through the ensuing years, some becoming more successful than others. Each finds their own way. Two of them marry, one is gay, one accuses another of rape, one marries someone outside the circle (Dan), and one runs off and assumes another identity in order to escape the errors of his ways. All of them are fully formed, and we live with them, their failures, successes, mistakes and conflicts as they age and face the exigencies of life.There is some crude language and also there are unnecessary sex scenes which add nothing to the story's development. From my perspective, relevant and important subjects, like intermarriage, motherhood, parental death, divorce, separation, the Aids epidemic, premarital sex, drug use, and even autism, are only casually referenced and not fully explored, while, at the same time, largely irrelevant, liberal political views run rampant, throughout the text, at every opportunity. Wealth and the evil it spawns, coupled with its alter ego, privation, a problem apparently caused by the rich, in the author's view, are mentioned as well. (The expression of the author's personal political views seems to be a very common theme running through the novels today. Authors seem to want to express their personal views and not so subtly plant references to them.)The story is sometimes repetitious as it is retold from different character's points of view as events play out.These are not perfect characters; they have flawed families and imperfect lives, with all of the sundry normal problems and not so normal ones in evidence. They have emotional trauma, mental and physical issues and even legal problems to deal with at various points of the narrative. All of the themes are knitted together in the end when the story comes full circle. There are villains and heroes.In the end, it is about life changes and changing needs as we age. It is about money and the lack of it, what money can buy and what money can destroy. It is about beauty and the lack of it. It is about the relevancy and irrelevancy of issues that sometimes seem so important at one stage of life and so trivial at another. Still, sometimes it takes almost a lifetime to work out the effects of some events in our lives, in order to move forward and live again. Life isn't fair and it isn't a fairy tale. It is not for sissies.Absent the political bias which flies off the pages expressing the author's dislike of conservative politics, it is a really \"interesting\" study of a group of teens as they grow and mature, learn how to make choices, some good and some bad, and come to realize that being \"interesting\" is in the eye of the beholder and its importance depends on circumstances and moments in time. There are many poignant moments, and moments of truth, witnessed by the reader for each of the characters. In the end, most of the characters are altruistic and soon discover that money does not always lift up the rich, but often corrupts them. It is a person's behavior, hopes and dreams that define them, not their money or position or their popularity and beauty.</td>\n",

Still, Dekker has kept up the exact same writing style throughout the years, and it's such a fantastic unique way with words and descriptions that never gets ahead of itself or tries to sound overly wordy or philosophical for its own sake... and I think it's what's kept him famous thus far, and what is also helping his fan base to grow.'Sinner' is a story based on the older 'Showdown,' and is also the last book in the Paradise Novel Series (though they say the 3 can be read in any order, which I disagree with), 'Showdown' being the first and 'Saint' being sort of a distance 2nd book that has no real alignment with this book's timeline.The characters from 'Showdown' are back as grown ups who work in the real world and have inherited supernatural powers (Billy can read minds, Darcy can influence people to do pretty much anything with the power of her voice and Johnney can have people see the true Kingdom of Heaven through one look of his blinded eyes). Yea, if this all sounds far-fetched so far, you haven't heard anything yet.The story takes place in the near future, around 2035, where the United States is basically at a sort of religious and cultural civil war where extremism in religion has reached a boiling point, Christians are looked down upon and no longer respected and mostly tolerated, and Islam has become the religion of choice in America. Without going into much detail the story is basically about Billy and Darcy being hired by the U.S. government to use their powers to influence people in the States out of all this racial and religious tension, as well as eventually influencing foreign nations to agree with the U.S. on pretty much whatever the heck it wants. Eventually they decide to enact an Amendment that prohibits religious expression and Johnney being the only devout Christian of the 3 decides to take this head on with his own small army of 3, which eventually becomes 3000 in the small town of Paradise (the town focused on in the first book 'Showdown') to fight the bill and keep religious expression alive for the sake of Christianity.Now the reason I gave this book only 3 stars is because of how much it tries to cover so many subjects at one time, and eventually using so much time to describe all the problems and tensions going on in America that Dekker must sacrifice character development in the process. Marsuvees Black (the villian from the first book, again, 'Showdown') is back but only makes brief appearances as he isn't necessarily a vital part of the story. In fact, the problem is that NOTHING is really a vital part of a story that seems to be using so many unrelated things to tell one central story, that the reader simply just stops really caring about trying to guess what will happen or feeling tense or thrilled about anything and is basically just forced to sit back and accept everything that's going on - thus leaving the reader out of any sort of relation they might have with the book. So what keeps this story afloat? Mostly Ted Dekker's writing, he's a good writer, a very good one, and the reader (most especially his fans) will keep pages turning to see when things will finally start to click together and make sense.Still, things never really do make sense as the story has a tendency to become pretty far-fetched and downright supernaturally hokey (an example being when Johnney pits himself with both Billy and Darcy in what seems to be a power-struggle STARING contest... the reader can only role their eyes at such moments. Or when a teenage rebel named Kat is at school and tries to stop a mob of extremist teenage Muslims from throwing things in the cafeteria shouting 'may the will of Allah be done!' and begins yelling how Jesus taught we are all to love each other, and said teenagers and school are never mentioned again... the reader just feels like they're getting put through filler material).Anyway, this all leads to a very cheesy and anticlimactic ending in which the battle of good and evil is ended for the moment, and at the last 2 chapters the reader already pretty much knows what's going to happen and is personally tired of all the supernatural far-fetched and forced Hocus Pocus that I would not be surprised if you just skimmed through he last 20 pages just to have the book done with. That is of course to the readers who haven't already grown impatient by the middle of the book. It almost made me laugh listening to characters continuously repeat \"kill him! kill him already!\" only to have the villain laugh and smile repeating the predictable \"you can't kill me\" type lines. Yes, this type of dialogue actually goes on for an ENTIRE CHAPTER by the end of the book. More impatient and picky readers would probably palm their faces saying 'Ted, just end it already, this is embarrassing.'And just to add another tidbit - the \"villain,\" Marsuvees Black I believe was excellent in the first book, 'Showdown,' and had a lot of depth and character, but in this one just comes off as NOTHING like his earlier self, and just another stereotypical bad guy who laughs and talks too much, but doesn't ever really do anything bad to anyone at all. You don't hate him or are afraid of him, you just wonder when he'll die already.Ted Dekker fans will most likely be disappointed by how ridiculous this book becomes at times, and though some aspects of the story become interesting (particularly Kat's character which to much dismay was pitifully WASTED, and Darcy's and Billy's exchanges with each other earlier in the book before the last quarter where everyone just seems to keep yelling all the time), but for the sake of a whole, what kills this book is both the poor pacing, disjointed scenarios, uneven storytelling, and huge sacrifice in any sort of meaningful and in-depth character development. You simply don't care very much about these people or relate to ANY of them in the least bit. Ted is a great writer and while this book wasn't terrible, it was merely OK, but in comparison with his earlier works, this just doesn't hold a candle. He needs to get back to the magic that made his earlier, more romantic books so special (Thr3e, Blessed Child, When Heaven Weeps, Showdown, Circle Trilogy) and take a break from these stretches in trying to write overly dramatic supernatural thrillers.</td>\n",

I wasn't paying attention to anything but the price and the author when I ordered it.

If I try to tell too much more of the plot, I'll run the risk of this review being longer than the \"book\".

The writing's fairly taut and fresh and the plot cracks along but the modern tone, though justified by the surprise plot twist at the end, seems remarkably out of place. We get a fairly good tour of the English (and Welsh) countryside as our reluctant viking protagonist learns to raid and kill in the best tradition of his forebears, gets lost from his raiding party and hooks up with a lovely, if mysterious, female companion and finally finds his shipmates again, only to get swept overboard, with the girl, and end up in the monastery at Lindisfarne just prior to the historical raid on that site which kicked off the full scale viking age in England -- which was to trouble the natives there for the next hundred years or so. We get an oddly bracing picture of these vikings too, professional warriors that they were, as they ready themselves for each upcoming encounter (not unlike the limbering-up exercises of a modern football team about to meet the \"other side\" out on the gridiron in a friendly match) -- you almost have to believe in the realism of it all, despite the warm fuzzy feeling you get once you've really gotten to know these boys. Even Thorfinn Skullsplitter seems like the kind of guy you wouldn't mind splitting a beer with -- assuming that's all he's in the mood for cleaving. But the dragon stuff seems rather forced and out of place. And the end, clever as it is, only adds to the sense that this book and this author didn't quite know where they wanted to go with the story. The protagonist's \"voice\" lapses into a rather sophomoric, counter-cultural patois as the tale winds down, which is both jarring and debilitating to the rest of the tale. And, though it's justified by the ending, the ending itself is discordant with what went before. You may guess it from the way the story moves, but I doubt you'll figure out the locale.The surprise ending in this one seems to have pleased many readers but I found it a bit off-putting, myself, turning what had seemed to me to be a good, and nicely paced, historical yarn into something a bit too self-concious and cute. I prefer my viking tales with a larger dash of authenticity so the abrupt plot twist which brings this one to a close, left me a bit cold.But it's nicely written and holds the reader to the end.SWM</td>\n",

I would like to see a book for Drew Anderson but not if he can't stand on his own. I was so hoping Jeremy's story would come about from a bet with his cousin Amy.  Jeremy used to be a lovable rake; in this book he didn't seem like a rake at all. Kinda boring.  Wasn't really thrilled with Danny either.</td>\n",

There is a clearly defined mythology, religion, political system, philosophy and ecology in this world.  Despite all the introduced terminology in the book, I feel it is easy enough for the reader to pick up and understand these new terms.Having said that, I did not find the main characters, or many of the other characters, interesting.  Paul and Jessica are unappealing characters because of their seeming penchant for all of their actions to be based on political reasons.  While there is a need for it at times, it seems like all of their actions are made for manuvering their survival on Arrakis.  I feel that the better characters are Gurney Halleck and Dr. Yueh.  Both men have detailed backstories that fully explain their motivations in the actions they take, which are made for a myriad of reasons, not just political.I felt that the book would have benefitted from more of a balance between action and political intrigue.  The action sequences that did take place were ok, and would have kept my interest more.I realize that I am in the minority with my opinion of Dune.  I give Herbert a lot of credit for creating a fully imagined and detailed world, and this novel was no doubt groundbreaking at the time of publication.  For me, the book would have benefitted more if the same detail had been paid to his characterizations.</td>\n",

Add to this a narrator whose first-person, documental prose discusses everything from his father being transferred to a labor camp to, at the end of the novel, his blas&amp;eacute; reaction to his father's death in the camps.  Thinking back on it, this was one of the central problems for me: his reactions, even to the most horrific experiences (like finding out that there were crematoria in the camps), was unconvincingly cool and aloof.In one of the last sentences of \"Fateless,\" Gyorgy says \"Everybody will ask me about the deprivations, the `terror of the camps,' but for me, the happiness there will always be the most memorable experience, perhaps.  Yes, that's what I'll tell them the next time they ask me: about the happiness in those camps.\"  I wonder what survivors today would say about that sentence; I do not deny that some might find it interesting, but I would be curious about the average reaction that a Holocaust survivor had to it.  What I find most disconcerting about this is not that he could have found happiness in the camps.  We are forced to find our own ways to survive psychologically, after all.  But nothing in the book leading up to that sentence would have led the reader to believe that it was true.  As a result, the whole thing ended up feeling false, more like a series of diary entries than a coherent, lucid account of concentration camp life.  I use the term \"diary entries\" here because, while so many people claim that this is biographical or semi-biographical novel, Kertesz has purportedly denied this is true.But I should note some important qualifications.  I didn't read the novel in Hungarian, I may have been in a particularly non-receptive mood while reading it, et cetera.  Another reviewer wrote, \"In the end I remained as detached and as unengaged as Gyorgy himself.\"  I agree.  And because of that, I'm afraid it will not stick with me in the same way, say, that Primo Levi's \"The Periodic Table\" has.I was glad this was not, as so much popular Holocaust fiction is, a simplistic story of \"good triumphing over evil.\"  Kertesz never turns the events in the camps into some gratuitous pornography of atrocity after atrocity, leaving us to sanctimoniously shake our heads in disapproval.  How true is it?  In some ways, I hope I will never find out.  But the sincerity of his literary effort and vision are not something I cannot call into question.</td>\n",

              "      <td>As a science writer, I can't help but open this review by noting that Alten's submerged (as in under the known seafloor) ancient sea habitat is difficult to believe in. I will give the author credit for offering  a foreword that goes into the geology and palentology of his scenario. I won't nitpick any further on this: It's the author's setting, it's a given, and what the reader wants is to see is how well he uses it.As prose, this book is a step back from Alten's The Loch, which I thought a very good novel. Hell's Aquarium uses a breathless style with lots of dashes and exclamation points in the narrative.  Alten's work in The Loch showed he didn't need that sort of gimmickry, and I'm not sure why he uses it here.Most of the characters are three-dimensional: Alten has improved on this from book to book. His strength, as always, is fast-moving action, and there are some real page-turner moments. Alten has a knack for popular culture: I loved the Internet contest that resulted in naming two captive Megalodons Mary-Kate and Ashley. A final thing I liked was the ending, not for its plausibility, but for springing a genuine surprise about who lives and who dies.Alten likes to pile on the creatures and maximize their sizes.  This is ok: it's fiction, and if Peter Benchley can use a 100-foot squid, Alten can use a 122-foot Liopleurodon. (I liked his 25-foot evolved form of the vampire squid Vampyroteuthis infernalis - that would be scary as hell in real life.) It's not clear how creatures from eras over 200 million years apart could have ended up in this habitat, although I'll buy anything that allows bringing my favorite predator Dunkleosteus on stage.  Alten takes pains to emphasize there's a complete food web in the \"aquarium,\" although, like Peter Jackson's take on Skull Island, it still seems too slanted toward megapredators. All the big reptiles are here (evolved gills and all), along with a squadron of sharks and even a monster turtle. This makes for an exciting series of beast-on-beast conflicts as the humans bascially try to avoid becoming snacks. Alten has some good moments of description concerning the creatures and their dark, cold, deep habitat.As a cryptozoological researcher, I kept thinking of Bernard Heuvelmans' dissection of sea-serpent reports into as many as nine species. Alten's beasts could cover all those categories and then some. There hasn't really been a mention of cryptozoology in the Meg series since the first book, and it would have been fun to throw in a prominent cryptozoologist to react to the fact that, while cryptozoology has been chasing a new shark here and a giant eel there, there's been a horde of spectacular creatures unguessed-at.The level of cooperation and intelligence shown by some of Alten's sharks goes beyond what we know of real sharks, although the Megs, at least, have had 60 million years to evolve this way, so mark that as a permissible fiction-author liberty. At the end, two escaped Megs are setting themselves up as new apex predators of their own patch of the coastal Pacific, violently displacing the orcas which have been used to being on top. I'll be curious to see whether Alten follows that up in the next sequel. There's some interesting science he could go into, if he so chooses, about what would happen in an event like that.I thought the third Meg novel was a little better written than this one.  I thought The Loch was better still, and it puzzles me that Alten has slipped back from the quality (in this reader's opinion, of course) of his best novel.Overall, Hell's Aquarium is what it's supposed to be, which is fun. It's like going to a Transformers film. You wonder about plot holes and implausible escapes, but you came to see the robots in action. You pick up an Alten novel to see the creatures in action. Hell's Aquarium gives you what you pay for.</td>\n",

There is no answer to questions such as whether a terrorist can legitimately be tortured to reveal the location of a bomb, or whether an innocent life can be sacrificed to save many lives. What the book does have, however,  is Mill's revised version of utilitarianism that is important because it plays a major role in his other works such as \"Liberty\".Much of the book explains and agrees with Bentham's version of utilitarianism that has no place for rights and replaces the concept of good/evil with pleasure/pain, but Mill's version of utilitarianism has an important difference - the claim that some pleasures are intrinsically superior to others, and if this is so then utilitarianism should strive to enable everybody to enjoy the superior pleasures.Mill defines utilitarianism as the \"Greatest Happiness Principle\" that judges \"actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\"  In this he is following Bentham's definition, but Bentham had devised a \"felicific calculus\" to determine the amount of pleasure (and hence moral worth) arising from any given action. It depended on things such as the intensity, duration and number of people affected. Bentham did not believe that one pleasure is in any way better than another except in terms of quantity. He wrote, for example, that \"Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry.\"Mill disagrees with this relativism, arguing that \"some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.\" In other words, quality is more important than quantity. Here we see the elitism that we find in all Mill's works. He asks how one can judge between the pleasure derived by two people from different actions and he answers that the person of what he calls \"higher faculties\" is the one to judge, if he can understand the relative merits of both actions and the other person cannot. Translating to a modern context we might ask why Mill would believe a Shakespeare play to be \"better\" than a TV reality show. Mill would claim that the person of \"higher faculties\" who fully appreciated Shakespeare would be able to see the merits of both and hence judge, whilst the other person could only appreciate the reality show and be unable to judge the relative merits of both.Mill seems to ditch the pleasure principle almost entirely at one point when suggesting that those with higher faculties are likely to find it more difficult to be happy because they realize the world is imperfect. But that realization does not make them envy the happiness of those with lower capabilities. In Mill's famous words\"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.\"It follows for Mill that if some pleasures are superior to others then it would be a good thing if more people could enjoy the higher pleasures. Mill believes that utilitarianism should aim at the general advancement of mankind for it can \"only attain its end by the general cultivation of nobleness of character.\"This edition of \"Utilitarianism\" also contains Mill's 1868 speech on capital punishment delivered to the English Parliament. Mill supports the use of capital punishment for murder and has two main arguments:1. Capital punishment is much more effective as a deterrent than any alternative.2. Capital punishment is more humane than incarceration for life, which Mill assumes to be the only alternative to the death penalty. He writes: \"What comparison can there really be, in point of severity, between consigning a man to the short pang of a rapid death, and immuring him in a living tomb, there to linger out what may be a long life in the hardest and most monotonous toil, without any of its alleviations.\"Nobody of Mill's generation contemplated the modern situation where many murderers in Britain as in most other</td>\n",

And then the book ended the same way, as if you turned the movie off with out seeing the conclusion. If I did not know that there were several other books in the series, I think that I would have been reviewing Freedom's Landing in a better light. I say this because this story felt more like a dream that you look back upon after waking. The beginning might be hazy and the end is where the alarm clock took over.This is a pretty crazy tale; aliens invade earth and round up slaves from major cities. They use whips to force people into the ships as if they were cattle. If you read the book think about how strange some aspects of her story are. The dialogue is pretty bad, but then again, I think she was aiming towards a younger audience than myself, so I forgive her for that.If you're looking for a good female science fiction writer and were seeing if McCaffrey was a starting point on that endeavor, pass her by for the time being. Instead concentrate on Connie Willis and her book 'To say nothing of the dog.'</td>\n",

There is no answer to questions such as whether a terrorist can legitimately be tortured to reveal the location of a bomb, or whether an innocent life can be sacrificed to save many lives. What the book does have, however,  is Mill's revised version of utilitarianism that is important because it plays a major role in his other works such as \\\"Liberty\\\".Much of the book explains and agrees with Bentham's version of utilitarianism that has no place for rights and replaces the concept of good/evil with pleasure/pain, but Mill's version of utilitarianism has an important difference - the claim that some pleasures are intrinsically superior to others, and if this is so then utilitarianism should strive to enable everybody to enjoy the superior pleasures.Mill defines utilitarianism as the \\\"Greatest Happiness Principle\\\" that judges \\\"actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\\\"  In this he is following Bentham's definition, but Bentham had devised a \\\"felicific calculus\\\" to determine the amount of pleasure (and hence moral worth) arising from any given action. It depended on things such as the intensity, duration and number of people affected. Bentham did not believe that one pleasure is in any way better than another except in terms of quantity. He wrote, for example, that \\\"Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry.\\\"Mill disagrees with this relativism, arguing that \\\"some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.\\\" In other words, quality is more important than quantity. Here we see the elitism that we find in all Mill's works. He asks how one can judge between the pleasure derived by two people from different actions and he answers that the person of what he calls \\\"higher faculties\\\" is the one to judge, if he can understand the relative merits of both actions and the other person cannot. Translating to a modern context we might ask why Mill would believe a Shakespeare play to be \\\"better\\\" than a TV reality show. Mill would claim that the person of \\\"higher faculties\\\" who fully appreciated Shakespeare would be able to see the merits of both and hence judge, whilst the other person could only appreciate the reality show and be unable to judge the relative merits of both.Mill seems to ditch the pleasure principle almost entirely at one point when suggesting that those with higher faculties are likely to find it more difficult to be happy because they realize the world is imperfect. But that realization does not make them envy the happiness of those with lower capabilities. In Mill's famous words\\\"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question.
