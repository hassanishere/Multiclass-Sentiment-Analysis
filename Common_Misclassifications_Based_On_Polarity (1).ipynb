I'm trying to like this book, it had so many good reviews.  I have some of this author's other cookbooks, have been very pleased.  On the plus side, the recipes look very healthy.   \n",

I thought it was a little heavy on the nitty-gritty of the investigation and a little light on story and plot, but if you're a CSI fan, you will probably enjoy it.  I did.   \n",

Almost didn't finish it, but I'm glad I did because the end was the best part of the book, nicely wrapping up all of the various plot ends.  I didn't know enough about abalone to care about their poaching, my problem, but it wasn't until mid-book that there was a brief explanation of why they were even a product anyone would want to poach, and why I should care. And what about all of the shells, doesn't someone want to make jewelry and buttons?  The main character Marquez, game warden, didn't have the flair of some other game wardens I have read and reviewed lately.  Perhaps the plodding day to day activity more accurately reflects the life, but it doesn't make for an exciting read. The pregnant partner not wanting to go on desk duty was too obvious that something ill fated was in store for her.  That was the only tension: when is this going to happen.  The attempt to make informer Davies believably eccentric fell short in that, like all of the characters, he needed more fleshing out.  The best and redeeming part of the book is when Marquez talks to his step daughter about her depression and eating disorder (if only it were that easy, but still perhaps helpful to some in similar situations). I think the basic idea was sound, just needed something more...maybe some more use of dialog to set up characters and less brief descriptions of the action.   \n",

The author made Christian Grey likable by making him truly sincere, decent, and loving. He is also a self-made billionaire at 27 and a complete sex-expert. He speaks fluent French and plays the piano like a pro. Oh, and obviously he is a brilliant Harvard drop-out. Clearly, Christian is the hottest emotional mess with mommy issues the author could possibly come up with. In real life, though, people like him are also self-absorbed narcissists and ruthless sociopaths, so what women should do when they come across somebody like him is run as far away from him as they can. There's some obsession in our society with dysfunctional personalities, which I do not seem to share. I heard that in the second book they have a vanilla relationship, so maybe the second book is worth reading more than the first one.   \n",

Deveraux is employed as a public defender, but is rescued from the world of arraignments because of his privileged past, and is allowed to second-seat the head of the office as defense counsel on a murder trial.This writer doesn't want to give the story away, but the narrative does ring true as a real story of a real lawyer, except perhaps when the criminals in the story use criminal slang ten times too many.  The title refers to the fact that most criminal activity occurs at night, so if one could find \"A Cure for Night\" there would be little need for criminal defense.Early in the book, Joel and the paralegal discuss the prospects for her entering law school, and it is clear then that anyone should think very carefully about whether they are suited for the practice of law.  By the suspenseful end, Joel has certainly figured this out.   \n",

It is really part cookbook and part fun read, however, as much of the book is taken up with the recipes.  After reading it, I passed it on to a friend who is from Nashville and who enjoys the southern culture and cooking.  Enjoy it for a light read and a few laughs but know that it contains more recipes than anything else.   \n",

It's got lots of glossy pictures of delicious-looking cakes and an extensive guide on cooking implements. Yup, beautiful.Now, I did expect, coming from a very famous, skilled chef, to get a book that wasn't exactly what you'd call simple. Of course, his experience was going to show somewhere so no, I didn't expect easy stuff. But I'm something of an avid baker so even if I don't have any professional training, I do pretty well in the kitchen. Imagine my surprise when several of his recipes did flop on me. This is ridiculous! I'm one to follow instructions to the best of my abilities but I think he takes for granted that you know so much more on so many levels than any non-chef does. I never did try the failed recipes again but did try others and fared a little better. They really are delicious.  Still, I don't like thinking when I start baking that there's a 50% chance that the recipe may not come out well.Never had any trouble at all baking extensively from other books. This one, I'm getting a little bit better but by trial and error, not through useful insight gained from the book. But the best part, this book does inspire me to keep trying.I'll get your cakes yet, Nick Malgieri!   \n",
              "14  Tintin is sent by his Brussels newspaper to expose the true conditions of life in Bolshevik Russia, and counter the propaganda spread by Soviets and their Western fellow-travellers.  Together with his faithful fox terrier Snowy, Tintin finds famine, child hunger, bureaucratic incompetence, industrial failure, bogus propaganda, state terror, gunpoint elections and massive embezzlement of the people's wealth by the government.  Naturally, the Soviets aren't terribly keen for such information to leak out, and attempt to dispatch our hero at every turn - trying to bomb, shoot at, torture and freeze him in the endless snowy Steppes.'Tintin In The Land Of The Soviets' is the first Tintin adventure, written in 1929 for a Catholic newspaper edited by a priest who would become a Nazi collaborator.  The book's propaganda is crude - as the translators point out, Herge never visited Russia, and based his 'facts' on a contemporary, reactionary book by a Belgian consul - and leaves a sour taste in the mouth.  It's not that what he shows wasn't accurate - his Soviet Russia is a totalitarian nightmare, swarming with vicious secret police; a place where citizens had their property stolen and labour abused; where starvation, torture and murder was rife; where more state effort went into destruction than construction.  The book is filled with booze-sozzled goons are frightening precisely because they have a power they don't deserve.  A lingering superstitiousness undermines this brave new world, and the images are full of delapidation and things crashing and falling apart - nothing can possibly work in such an environment.  The 'Wizard of Oz'-like scene where a guide shows gullible English communists industrial marvels that are really two men billowing smoke and rattling sheet metal, is horribly accurate.  This comic look at misery and tyranny looks forward to the Czech films of the 60s.  Nonetheless, the book never becomes satire, never moves beyond popular prejudices - the critique in 'Tintin In America' is far more effective because Herge displays a more thorough knowledge of and engagement with US history and culture.The 'Tintin's we are familiar with now - painstakingly illustrated, beautifully coloured and meticulously detailed albums - only came into being in the mid-40s: earlier editions were redrafted and edited to fit the new format.  This book was the only one Herge didn't remodel, perhaps embarrassed in retrospect by its crass ideology.  Reading 'Soviets' after one of the later 'Tintin's is like watching an Ub Iwerks cartoon after 'Toy Story'.  The drawing is sometimes cruder and much less detailed than we're used to, like a loose-limbed 'Peanuts' strip.  Instead of the four strips of four columns of the later books, there are three strips of two columns - each frame is much larger and seems to lunge at the reader.  The positioning of speech bubbles is often clumsy; frequently, characters redundantly say what we can clearly see; the angle of compositions sometimes works against the action - all this can prevent a fluid reading.  Tintin himself is a different beast - beefier, more aggressive, even high-handed with a splendidly cynical Snowy - he roughs up a Cheka agent, easily dispatches a vodka-guzzling bear, and trips up passers-by whenever the need arises.Despite these flaws, 'Soviets' is a pacy and funny adventure.  Two things Herge arrived with fully formed were: his ability to express speed within and across frames; and his fascination with gorgeous moving vehicles (motorcars, trains, planes, boats) stretching across the plate.   \n",

It makes you wonder how this girl ever managed to grow up to be a decent upstanding daughter with a mother who was an alcoholic that never could accept being left behind , a father who put more into his career than he did his family and a step mother who tried her best to be the picture of a loving mother. Really is a good book.   \n",

I'm not a fan of short stories, especially short romances - girl always gets guy with no conflict whatsoever. This story was an advertisement for a charity helping single mothers, which was annoying. How hard the life is for single mothers was over-emphasized - it became a bit preachy by the end of the story. Hello, why not single parents? Why just single mothers? Single dads have the same issues (child care, time off from work for sick kids, having to do it all, etc.). Bottom-line - it's free, reading it passed the time, and since it was short, the preaching ended before it was too annoying. Just be aware of what you're getting - this is not the usual Robin Carr, which I really enjoy.   \n",

Why did I keep reading? Bored I guess.  The story goes back and forth between two different people Hahp and Sadima. It gets you really mad with most of the characters expecially Somiss. Hardly anything possitive happens and you keep reading hoping that this depressing book will get better. I'm not always looking for happy endings but geesh.... This was bad.   \n",

I loved the first two books and didn't really care for the last one at all, so probably won't read the others, if any are forthcoming. It's like the author got lost after book 2 and now doesn't know how to end it. I read the sample from book 4 and was bored with the repetitious nature within 40 pages - think it's played out.   \n",

The authors take the history of Freemasonry (actually, the mystic legends that surround Freemasonry) and tie it to the &quot;real&quot; story of Jesus Christ. When you link conspiracies to Christianity, you're going to get under someone's skin.But few books are as fascinating to read as this one. Think of it as one-third truth and two-thirds speculation. If the authors called it a fictional account --- a fantasy about the way things might be --- the result would be a strange sort of historical novel. It's wouldn't be as compelling. Instead, they present this story as nonfiction, breathlessly uncovering the greatest secret in the history of mankind. It's an approach that keeps you reading. In the end, you'll enjoy the story as a series of curious &quot;what if&quot; possibilities. If half of this is true, the world is more interesting than you thought.   \n",

Could Cornwell create new characters as likeable and intriguing as Scarpetta et al?  Hornet's Nest was interesting, a good read,  but Southern Cross goes just a bit too far -- I found myself wondering if I  was reading a serious crime novel or a spoof of a crime novel. The plot is  a bit of a stretch, and overall, the book lacks a certain edge that  Cornwell has consistently demonstrated in her Scarpetta novels.   \n",

Frederica has been raised by liberal college professor parents and is just beginning to rebel against their egalitarian child rearing practises when her father's unscrupulous and melodramatic ex-wife arrives on campus to stir things up in their well-ordered lives.Elinor Lipman is one of my favorite contemporary authors; her books are funny in an understated way, character driven, with ironic plot twists and satirical observations of modern life. If you click on the other Amazon reviews, you will find reviews that get rather defensive about why funny books can also be very good literature and why women's books can rise above chic-lit, but still be popular, and why Elinor Lipman has devoted fans but really ought to be a best-selling author and is under appreciated. And of course the nod to Jane Austen to whom all good women authors who write comedies of manners or anything close are compared. Leaving aside the defensiveness about humor and the obsession with Austen as the standard for all women's writing, you should read Lipman's books if you like a sardonic look at modern life. Readers don't have to suffer through oh-so-serious tomes to enjoy good literature. To find out more about her, read some of her essays posted on her website.   \n",

A really great storyline but just too slow and unromantic for my part. Definitely a good on  for most other readers though so enjoy.   \n",

First, the narrator, Essie, makes the following disclaimer within the first few pages: \"You''ll say I wasn't everywhere; you'll say there's no way I can know all that I've depicted. But I stand by all the truths in this story of deception.\" Unfortunately, just because you acknowledge upfront the improbabilities in the narrative given the author's chosen point of view, that doesn't make the improbabilities go away. That disclaimer actually makes things worse since it calls attention to the novel's big flaw.And I'm not sure if what I'm about to say will make much sense. This isn't by any means a bad book. In fact this book is quite well written. But it is written in the identical polished prose that I come across in so much serious contemporary literature. And for me it is becoming a little boring. I suppose what I'm talking about is style, or the lack thereof. For me this isn't a distinct or unique voice.   \n",

After the Battle of Loos he convalesced in Hampshire. A telegram summoned him to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Walter Bullivant. There is a potential danger from the Turkish Empire against the Allies. Hannay is to travel there to learn about this menace (Chapter 1). Hannay picks two aides: Sandy Arbuthnot and John S. Blenkiron (Chapter 2). In Portugal Hannay meets Peter Pienaar and takes him along (Chapter 3). They all travel into Germany and meet Ulric von Stumm (Chapter 4). The next two chapters tell of their travels in Germany. Hannay makes his escape and finds a refuge in the snowstorm (Chapter 7). He left to find a boat on the Danube (Chapter 8). Hannay finds Peter Pienaar and takes him aboard (Chapter 9). They arrive in Constantinople and find it eventful (Chapter 10). Will they be caught by their enemies (Chapter 11)?They rejoin Sandy and John. Germany wants to control the Near East (Chapter12). Hannay now poses as an American (Chapter 13). When Peter and Richard are lost at night they find a house and are directed back to the city (Chapter 14). A meeting with a Turkish officer creates a dangerous situation. Hilda von Einem visits him (Chapter 15). They all travel towards Erzerum and their motorcar breaks down (Chapter16). They steal another car to continue their journey but are arrested (Chapter 17). They are able to escape to a house outside the city (Chapter 18). Can they get the military secrets to the Russians (Chapter 19)? Chapter 20 tells how Peter crossed No-Man's Land in the night to reach the Russians. Richard and his friends try to escape to the Russian lines but are trapped on a hill (Chapter 21). Just as it seems hopeless the Russian guns and Cossack cavalry sweep away the Turkish army and German troops to provide a happy ending (Chapter 22). [Will this counteract the defeat at Gallipolli?]This was written in 1916, a bad year for the Allies. The German air force dominated the skies, until more advanced airplanes were produced for the French and British. This book can be viewed as propaganda for the Allied cause, a wish for the Russians to defeat Germany and come west. It points out the German interest in the oil-rich lands of the then Turkish Empire. Details of this story seem dated, but provides a view into the culture. John Buchan was a writer, barrister, member of Parliament, partner in a publishing house, a Church of Scotland official, and Governor-General of Canada. Few novelists have such a background.   \n",

We know who did it, but it was never stated in the book, therefore left with loose ends.Other than that, it was a very good book with many lines of suspense, and in the end our friend, Harry Bosch, comes out all right.   \n",

I did notice a few spelling errors that really did bother me. Don't people proof read before publishing a book? I did love the characters names! Avery and Cam make a great couple.   \n",

It's very well written and unlike many digital books, it was almost free of typos and miss-used words.  I read this type of novel for the mystery and crime interest rather than romance.  I appreciated the relationship that developed between the lead female and the male ex-cop, but I skimmed multiple paragraphs in order to avoid reading the descriptions of the love-making scenes.   \n",

I chose this book because I have read all the other books in the series and wanted to see what happens next.Rebecca Myles keeps her private life and her work life far apart as possible. She was badly hurt by her last Dom which has made her wary of getting into any serious relationship in general. She is a very smart and confident woman. She knows what she wants in her professional life and goes for it.Tyler Stone is not used to being turned down when I comes to business. He only wants the best and gets it. He is a handsome and dominating personality in and out of the bedroom.One of the problems I had with this story was it is unrealistic that a boss is close friends to be invited to a gathering outside of work. Especially a company the size that was depicted. In addition, who really wants there boss to see them outside of work? Maybe I am different but work is work and personal life is personal life.The chemistry between Rebecca and Tyler was off the charts. The sex scenes are very hot and spicy but there were not enough BDSM elements. I did not get the sensory deprivation tank. I know some people enjoy it but it was not believable that she adjusted so well in her first trip inside the tank.This was a very well written story. I wish there was more description of BDSM elements in their relationship. Overall, this was a wonderful story and a great addition to the story. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series.   \n",

And the best part is that it's got little quotes from fathers throughout, including the most anguished, troubled kinds of dilemmas, making me feel more human for my difficulty rising to the challenge sometimes. One Dad laments, \"It all seems like a blur. I sometimes have to fight very hard to remember what he was like even one month or one week ago. Every time I turn around, he's doing something new. I don't want to miss anything. It all makes me wonder whether I've been around enough.\" But then beautiful moments too, \"She screams with delight and babbles incessantly. Who knows what she's thinking.\" \"My son's crawling. He comes bouncing up to me, smiling his head off. It cracks me up, and I laugh hysterically. He crawls right up on my lap and nibbles my nose.\" I'd grade this a B.   \n",

I really enjoy the early Sharpe work that Mr. Cornwell has written and his King Arthur trilogy is one of the most stirring accomplishments of the last 50 years. BUT Thomas of Hookton is no Richard Sharpe and the Grail is no Excalibur.  'Vagabond' is uneven in places with no real sense of 'quest' about it.  For all the roaming around our hero does, he seems to be jogging in place.  The killing of two characters from the earlier book is pointless and does nothing to further the story except clear the way for Thomas' former lover to return.  By the way, how many sieges must we read about?  This book has one at the beginning and one at the end.  Most redundant, considering we have already experienced a siege in 'The Archers Tale'.  Wait till the paperback comes out.   \n",

But when Becca's best friend Heather begs her to help prove that her parents are not enemies of the State, Becca starts to spy on her mother, suspecting her of arranging false confessions which cause innocent people to be tortured.Becca is a good character. She is honest and loyal, refusing to believe that Heather and her parents are the enemy, even when the whole school is against them. You can imagine how you would feel if your best friends parents were in this kind of trouble and you would want to help or believe it was all a mistake. Becca's snooping and her unguarded comments to her mother and friends is showing dissident traits which could see her executed if she is reported but she won't abandon her principles for an easier life, even if it is safer. I found Heather to be frustrating and a bit too changable to like but her character again is well written. When Jake comes on the scene, you are never too sure about him or his motivations which adds a bit of interest. The character that interested me the most was Becca's mother as we see different sides to her through the book that I liked. She is afraid of her daughter's behaviour and has to juggle loyalty to her with the demands of her job. She was complex and fun to read about and I think Becca's view of her mother is a bit unfair at times.The book flows nicely with no big info dumps or pointless descriptions. It is simple and effective character based storytelling which I like to see in a book. I also felt that the length of the book was just right. Adding more to it may have made the book feel too slow and having less would have resulted in missing out on the complex evolving of each character. It is good to see the author get the balance right.Plot wise, I liked the twists and turns as you are never quite sure what is going to be coming next. It gives you a real idea of what it would be like to live in this suspicious world where everyone is watching you to see that you conform to the government way of thinking. At the same time, the setting for the book is very much like the present day which lets the reader imagine that this could actually happen to them and lets them relate to the characters and their struggles. I like that the characters are flawed and make bad decisions.Overall this was a good novella/short book for YA and adult fans of dystopian books. No sexual scenes or f bombs every page.I rate this book 3 out of 5 on my star rating which is different to this site.1-didn't like2-ok3-like4-really liked5-loved   \n",

They were cute reads just not enough to truly pull it together. Have to say its not worth a reread. :(   \n",

It was full of facts on health benefits (most chiles do have capsicum which provide all sorts of healing benefits), and the recipes were mouthwatering. My only gripe was the book needed some editing, and it would have seen much more authoritative. John McDonalds get an A+++ for enthusiasm, and I love how he teaches you to make your own tasty Sriracha. If the book gets the edits it needs, I'd definitely bump up my star rating. Don't let the editorial issues dissuade you, though. What he lacks in this, he totally makes up for in love and enthusiasm!Disclosure: I received the book for the purposes of the review, but opinions are 100% mine and not influenced by other parties.   \n",

This book is certainly the deep end of the pool. It is the culmination of fifteen years' of scholarly research and is presented as a detailed apologetical of his faith. Of its 1000+ pages, 400 are appendices and notes.SACRED FIRE is so big it requires its own luggage. I had to valet check it. Not for the casual reader or faint of heart. But if someone ever challenges the fact that Washington was a Christian, you can whack him in the head with this book: it is pursuasive.   \n",

And what about all of the shells, doesn't someone want to make jewelry and buttons?  The main character Marquez, game warden, didn't have the flair of some other game wardens I have read and reviewed lately.  Perhaps the plodding day to day activity more accurately reflects the life, but it doesn't make for an exciting read. The pregnant partner not wanting to go on desk duty was too obvious that something ill fated was in store for her.  That was the only tension: when is this going to happen.  The attempt to make informer Davies believably eccentric fell short in that, like all of the characters, he needed more fleshing out.  The best and redeeming part of the book is when Marquez talks to his step daughter about her depression and eating disorder (if only it were that easy, but still perhaps helpful to some in similar situations). I think the basic idea was sound, just needed something more...maybe some more use of dialog to set up characters and less brief descriptions of the action.</td>\n",

Clearly, Christian is the hottest emotional mess with mommy issues the author could possibly come up with.

Deveraux is employed as a public defender, but is rescued from the world of arraignments because of his privileged past, and is allowed to second-seat the head of the office as defense counsel on a murder trial.This writer doesn't want to give the story away, but the narrative does ring true as a real story of a real lawyer, except perhaps when the criminals in the story use criminal slang ten times too many.  The title refers to the fact that most criminal activity occurs at night, so if one could find \"A Cure for Night\" there would be little need for criminal defense.Early in the book, Joel and the paralegal discuss the prospects for her entering law school, and it is clear then that anyone should think very carefully about whether they are suited for the practice of law.  By the suspenseful end, Joel has certainly figured this out.</td>\n",

Together with his faithful fox terrier Snowy, Tintin finds famine, child hunger, bureaucratic incompetence, industrial failure, bogus propaganda, state terror, gunpoint elections and massive embezzlement of the people's wealth by the government.  Naturally, the Soviets aren't terribly keen for such information to leak out, and attempt to dispatch our hero at every turn - trying to bomb, shoot at, torture and freeze him in the endless snowy Steppes.'Tintin In The Land Of The Soviets' is the first Tintin adventure, written in 1929 for a Catholic newspaper edited by a priest who would become a Nazi collaborator.  The book's propaganda is crude - as the translators point out, Herge never visited Russia, and based his 'facts' on a contemporary, reactionary book by a Belgian consul - and leaves a sour taste in the mouth.  It's not that what he shows wasn't accurate - his Soviet Russia is a totalitarian nightmare, swarming with vicious secret police; a place where citizens had their property stolen and labour abused; where starvation, torture and murder was rife; where more state effort went into destruction than construction.  The book is filled with booze-sozzled goons are frightening precisely because they have a power they don't deserve.  A lingering superstitiousness undermines this brave new world, and the images are full of delapidation and things crashing and falling apart - nothing can possibly work in such an environment.  The 'Wizard of Oz'-like scene where a guide shows gullible English communists industrial marvels that are really two men billowing smoke and rattling sheet metal, is horribly accurate.  This comic look at misery and tyranny looks forward to the Czech films of the 60s.  Nonetheless, the book never becomes satire, never moves beyond popular prejudices - the critique in 'Tintin In America' is far more effective because Herge displays a more thorough knowledge of and engagement with US history and culture.The 'Tintin's we are familiar with now - painstakingly illustrated, beautifully coloured and meticulously detailed albums - only came into being in the mid-40s: earlier editions were redrafted and edited to fit the new format.  This book was the only one Herge didn't remodel, perhaps embarrassed in retrospect by its crass ideology.  Reading 'Soviets' after one of the later 'Tintin's is like watching an Ub Iwerks cartoon after 'Toy Story'.  The drawing is sometimes cruder and much less detailed than we're used to, like a loose-limbed 'Peanuts' strip.  Instead of the four strips of four columns of the later books, there are three strips of two columns - each frame is much larger and seems to lunge at the reader.  The positioning of speech bubbles is often clumsy; frequently, characters redundantly say what we can clearly see; the angle of compositions sometimes works against the action - all this can prevent a fluid reading.  Tintin himself is a different beast - beefier, more aggressive, even high-handed with a splendidly cynical Snowy - he roughs up a Cheka agent, easily dispatches a vodka-guzzling bear, and trips up passers-by whenever the need arises.Despite these flaws, 'Soviets' is a pacy and funny adventure.  Two things Herge arrived with fully formed were: his ability to express speed within and across frames; and his fascination with gorgeous moving vehicles (motorcars, trains, planes, boats) stretching across the plate.</td>\n",

The authors take the history of Freemasonry (actually, the mystic legends that surround Freemasonry) and tie it to the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; story of Jesus Christ. When you link conspiracies to Christianity, you're going to get under someone's skin.But few books are as fascinating to read as this one. Think of it as one-third truth and two-thirds speculation. If the authors called it a fictional account --- a fantasy about the way things might be --- the result would be a strange sort of historical novel. It's wouldn't be as compelling. Instead, they present this story as nonfiction, breathlessly uncovering the greatest secret in the history of mankind. It's an approach that keeps you reading. In the end, you'll enjoy the story as a series of curious &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; possibilities. If half of this is true, the world is more interesting than you thought.</td>\n",

Frederica has been raised by liberal college professor parents and is just beginning to rebel against their egalitarian child rearing practises when her father's unscrupulous and melodramatic ex-wife arrives on campus to stir things up in their well-ordered lives.Elinor Lipman is one of my favorite contemporary authors; her books are funny in an understated way, character driven, with ironic plot twists and satirical observations of modern life. If you click on the other Amazon reviews, you will find reviews that get rather defensive about why funny books can also be very good literature and why women's books can rise above chic-lit, but still be popular, and why Elinor Lipman has devoted fans but really ought to be a best-selling author and is under appreciated. And of course the nod to Jane Austen to whom all good women authors who write comedies of manners or anything close are compared. Leaving aside the defensiveness about humor and the obsession with Austen as the standard for all women's writing, you should read Lipman's books if you like a sardonic look at modern life. Readers don't have to suffer through oh-so-serious tomes to enjoy good literature. To find out more about her, read some of her essays posted on her website.</td>\n",

That disclaimer actually makes things worse since it calls attention to the novel's big flaw.And I'm not sure if what I'm about to say will make much sense. This isn't by any means a bad book.

A telegram summoned him to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Walter Bullivant. There is a potential danger from the Turkish Empire against the Allies. Hannay is to travel there to learn about this menace (Chapter 1). Hannay picks two aides: Sandy Arbuthnot and John S. Blenkiron (Chapter 2). In Portugal Hannay meets Peter Pienaar and takes him along (Chapter 3). They all travel into Germany and meet Ulric von Stumm (Chapter 4). The next two chapters tell of their travels in Germany. Hannay makes his escape and finds a refuge in the snowstorm (Chapter 7). He left to find a boat on the Danube (Chapter 8). Hannay finds Peter Pienaar and takes him aboard (Chapter 9). They arrive in Constantinople and find it eventful (Chapter 10). Will they be caught by their enemies (Chapter 11)?They rejoin Sandy and John. Germany wants to control the Near East (Chapter12). Hannay now poses as an American (Chapter 13). When Peter and Richard are lost at night they find a house and are directed back to the city (Chapter 14). A meeting with a Turkish officer creates a dangerous situation. Hilda von Einem visits him (Chapter 15). They all travel towards Erzerum and their motorcar breaks down (Chapter16). They steal another car to continue their journey but are arrested (Chapter 17). They are able to escape to a house outside the city (Chapter 18). Can they get the military secrets to the Russians (Chapter 19)? Chapter 20 tells how Peter crossed No-Man's Land in the night to reach the Russians. Richard and his friends try to escape to the Russian lines but are trapped on a hill (Chapter 21). Just as it seems hopeless the Russian guns and Cossack cavalry sweep away the Turkish army and German troops to provide a happy ending (Chapter 22). [Will this counteract the defeat at Gallipolli?]This was written in 1916, a bad year for the Allies. The German air force dominated the skies, until more advanced airplanes were produced for the French and British. This book can be viewed as propaganda for the Allied cause, a wish for the Russians to defeat Germany and come west. It points out the German interest in the oil-rich lands of the then Turkish Empire. Details of this story seem dated, but provides a view into the culture. John Buchan was a writer, barrister, member of Parliament, partner in a publishing house, a Church of Scotland official, and Governor-General of Canada. Few novelists have such a background.</td>\n",

I chose this book because I have read all the other books in the series and wanted to see what happens next.Rebecca Myles keeps her private life and her work life far apart as possible. She was badly hurt by her last Dom which has made her wary of getting into any serious relationship in general. She is a very smart and confident woman. She knows what she wants in her professional life and goes for it.Tyler Stone is not used to being turned down when I comes to business. He only wants the best and gets it. He is a handsome and dominating personality in and out of the bedroom.One of the problems I had with this story was it is unrealistic that a boss is close friends to be invited to a gathering outside of work. Especially a company the size that was depicted. In addition, who really wants there boss to see them outside of work? Maybe I am different but work is work and personal life is personal life.The chemistry between Rebecca and Tyler was off the charts. The sex scenes are very hot and spicy but there were not enough BDSM elements. I did not get the sensory deprivation tank. I know some people enjoy it but it was not believable that she adjusted so well in her first trip inside the tank.This was a very well written story. I wish there was more description of BDSM elements in their relationship. Overall, this was a wonderful story and a great addition to the story.

But when Becca's best friend Heather begs her to help prove that her parents are not enemies of the State, Becca starts to spy on her mother, suspecting her of arranging false confessions which cause innocent people to be tortured.Becca is a good character. She is honest and loyal, refusing to believe that Heather and her parents are the enemy, even when the whole school is against them. You can imagine how you would feel if your best friends parents were in this kind of trouble and you would want to help or believe it was all a mistake. Becca's snooping and her unguarded comments to her mother and friends is showing dissident traits which could see her executed if she is reported but she won't abandon her principles for an easier life, even if it is safer. I found Heather to be frustrating and a bit too changable to like but her character again is well written. When Jake comes on the scene, you are never too sure about him or his motivations which adds a bit of interest. The character that interested me the most was Becca's mother as we see different sides to her through the book that I liked. She is afraid of her daughter's behaviour and has to juggle loyalty to her with the demands of her job. She was complex and fun to read about and I think Becca's view of her mother is a bit unfair at times.The book flows nicely with no big info dumps or pointless descriptions. It is simple and effective character based storytelling which I like to see in a book. I also felt that the length of the book was just right. Adding more to it may have made the book feel too slow and having less would have resulted in missing out on the complex evolving of each character. It is good to see the author get the balance right.Plot wise, I liked the twists and turns as you are never quite sure what is going to be coming next. It gives you a real idea of what it would be like to live in this suspicious world where everyone is watching you to see that you conform to the government way of thinking. At the same time, the setting for the book is very much like the present day which lets the reader imagine that this could actually happen to them and lets them relate to the characters and their struggles. I like that the characters are flawed and make bad decisions.Overall this was a good novella/short book for YA and adult fans of dystopian books. No sexual scenes or f bombs every page.I rate this book 3 out of 5 on my star rating which is different to this site.1-didn't like2-ok3-like4-really liked5-loved</td>\n",

After the Battle of Loos he convalesced in Hampshire. A telegram summoned him to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Walter Bullivant. There is a potential danger from the Turkish Empire against the Allies. Hannay is to travel there to learn about this menace (Chapter 1). Hannay picks two aides: Sandy Arbuthnot and John S. Blenkiron (Chapter 2). In Portugal Hannay meets Peter Pienaar and takes him along (Chapter 3). They all travel into Germany and meet Ulric von Stumm (Chapter 4). The next two chapters tell of their travels in Germany. Hannay makes his escape and finds a refuge in the snowstorm (Chapter 7). He left to find a boat on the Danube (Chapter 8). Hannay finds Peter Pienaar and takes him aboard (Chapter 9). They arrive in Constantinople and find it eventful (Chapter 10). Will they be caught by their enemies (Chapter 11)?They rejoin Sandy and John. Germany wants to control the Near East (Chapter12). Hannay now poses as an American (Chapter 13). When Peter and Richard are lost at night they find a house and are directed back to the city (Chapter 14). A meeting with a Turkish officer creates a dangerous situation. Hilda von Einem visits him (Chapter 15). They all travel towards Erzerum and their motorcar breaks down (Chapter16). They steal another car to continue their journey but are arrested (Chapter 17). They are able to escape to a house outside the city (Chapter 18). Can they get the military secrets to the Russians (Chapter 19)? Chapter 20 tells how Peter crossed No-Man's Land in the night to reach the Russians. Richard and his friends try to escape to the Russian lines but are trapped on a hill (Chapter 21). Just as it seems hopeless the Russian guns and Cossack cavalry sweep away the Turkish army and German troops to provide a happy ending (Chapter 22). [Will this counteract the defeat at Gallipolli?]This was written in 1916, a bad year for the Allies. The German air force dominated the skies, until more advanced airplanes were produced for the French and British. This book can be viewed as propaganda for the Allied cause, a wish for the Russians to defeat Germany and come west. It points out the German interest in the oil-rich lands of the then Turkish Empire. Details of this story seem dated, but provides a view into the culture. John Buchan was a writer, barrister, member of Parliament, partner in a publishing house, a Church of Scotland official, and Governor-General of Canada. Few novelists have such a background.\",\n          \"While I didn't look forward to this as much as Brott's New Father, let alone Lamott's Operating Instructions, I did find parts of it really funny. And the best part is that it's got little quotes from fathers throughout, including the most anguished, troubled kinds of dilemmas, making me feel more human for my difficulty rising to the challenge sometimes. One Dad laments, \\\"It all seems like a blur. I sometimes have to fight very hard to remember what he was like even one month or one week ago. Every time I turn around, he's doing something new. I don't want to miss anything. It all makes me wonder whether I've been around enough.\\\" But then beautiful moments too, \\\"She screams with delight and babbles incessantly. Who knows what she's thinking.\\\" \\\"My son's crawling. He comes bouncing up to me, smiling his head off. It cracks me up, and I laugh hysterically. He crawls right up on my lap and nibbles my nose.\\\" I'd grade this a B.\",\n          \"I have two problems with this book. First, the narrator, Essie, makes the following disclaimer within the first few pages: \\\"You''ll say I wasn't everywhere; you'll say there's no way I can know all that I've depicted. But I stand by all the truths in this story of deception.\\\" Unfortunately, just because you acknowledge upfront the improbabilities in the narrative given the author's chosen point of view, that doesn't make the improbabilities go away. That disclaimer actually makes things worse since it calls attention to the novel's big flaw.And I'm not sure if what I'm about to say will make much sense. This isn't by any means a bad book. In fact this book is quite well written. But it is written in the identical polished prose that I come across in so much serious contemporary literature. And for me it is becoming a little boring. I suppose what I'm talking about is style, or the lack thereof.
